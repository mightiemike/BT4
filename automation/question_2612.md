# Q2612: linear-interpolate via liquidate-multi: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
