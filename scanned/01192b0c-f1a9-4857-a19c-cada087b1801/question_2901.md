# Q2901: createOutgoingPacket source sink direction against voucher burn

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.createOutgoingPacket` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling classID, tokenIDs, sender, receiver, focusing on class trace hash identity, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then create packet for several token ids where one fails mid-loop, causing `voucher burn` to diverge so the invariant `fullClassPath resolution matches stored class trace for IBC voucher ids` fails and the attacker can misorder token ids and uris to cause valuable metadata or token identity loss, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/packet.go::Keeper.createOutgoingPacket
- Entrypoint: MsgTransfer through Keeper.SendTransfer
- Attacker controls: classID, tokenIDs, sender, receiver, source channel, destination channel, timeout
- Exploit idea: misorder token ids and uris to cause valuable metadata or token identity loss by testing the source sink direction angle against `voucher burn` during `create packet for several token ids where one fails mid-loop`, with specific focus on class trace hash identity.
- Invariant to test: fullClassPath resolution matches stored class trace for IBC voucher ids; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test directly invoking SendTransfer with multi-token packets and class trace setup; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
