# Q0896: increment via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
