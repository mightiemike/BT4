# Q2004: calc-utilization via borrow: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `borrow` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `calc-utilization` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
