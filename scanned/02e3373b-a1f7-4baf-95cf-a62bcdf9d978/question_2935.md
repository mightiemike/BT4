# Q2935: Bonded/tombstoned status races corrupt active-voter decisions via State Transitions Around Join/Leave/Tombstone / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe when the attacker does not already control a privileged UV or admin role, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it time attacker-created flows so the protocol reads a stale UV status at a security-critical moment, breaking the invariant that active-voter eligibility must not diverge across one observation lifecycle, and resulting in Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can time attacker-created flows so the protocol reads a stale UV status at a security-critical moment.
- Invariant to test: active-voter eligibility must not diverge across one observation lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
