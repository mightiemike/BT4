# Q1502: l2 sync trusting sequencer signature via `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` (da_block_handler.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary, controlling conflicting L1 data across a reorg, drive `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` in `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` so that the block a node accepts from the L2 sync path and the block covered by a signed commitment stop being the same block, breaking the invariant that synced blocks are covered by sequencer authority?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` -> `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary
- Attacker controls: conflicting L1 data across a reorg
- Exploit idea: l2 sync trusting sequencer signature - reach `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the block a node accepts from the L2 sync path and the block covered by a signed commitment stop being the same block; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `ProcessingResult`, `ProofSource`, `L1BlockHandler`, `run`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: synced blocks are covered by sequencer authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: serve an unsigned block over the sync path and assert rejection
