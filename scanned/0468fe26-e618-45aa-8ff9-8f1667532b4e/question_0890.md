# Q890: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against future withdraw eligibility

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on reward checkpoint monotonicity, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then trigger exit at a boundary timestamp, clear it, trigger again, then withdraw, causing `future withdraw eligibility` to diverge so the invariant `exit state cannot be shortened, replayed, or cleared to bypass economic locks` fails and the attacker can clear and retrigger exit to confuse reward accounting and double claim, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: clear and retrigger exit to confuse reward accounting and double claim by testing the owner binding angle against `future withdraw eligibility` during `trigger exit at a boundary timestamp, clear it, trigger again, then withdraw`, with specific focus on reward checkpoint monotonicity.
- Invariant to test: exit state cannot be shortened, replayed, or cleared to bypass economic locks; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
