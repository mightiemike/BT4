# Q4966: interest-rate via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `min-collateral-expected`, can an unprivileged attacker make `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
