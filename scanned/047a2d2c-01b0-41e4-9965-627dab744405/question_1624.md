# Q1624: UTX identity collision merges distinct deposits via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Inbound Will Create Visible in Inbound.Canonicalize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when the inbound will create a visible UTX even if execution validation fails, and cause `Inbound.Canonicalize` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so that it make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another, breaking the invariant that each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.Canonicalize
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.Canonicalize` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so it can make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another.
- Invariant to test: each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
