# Q3721: Lifecycle state confusion makes a non-UV effectively eligible via Address Key Material Validate / Downstream Modules Trust Uv in Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities when downstream modules trust the UV identity for voting or offchain routing, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes, breaking the invariant that only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_universal_validator.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes.
- Invariant to test: only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
