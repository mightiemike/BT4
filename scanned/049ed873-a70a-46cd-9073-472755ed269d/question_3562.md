# Q3562: accrue-and-cache via redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
