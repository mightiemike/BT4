# Q4507: process-debt-asset via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `process-debt-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
