# Q1225: Lenient source-chain address canonicalization misbinds sender or asset via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.ExecuteInboundFundsAndPayload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundFundsAndPayload` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it present source-chain fields in a format that maps to the wrong sender or asset once canonicalized, breaking the invariant that canonicalization must not let one user-controlled formatting variant steal another asset or identity, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/execute_inbound_funds_and_payload.go::Keeper.ExecuteInboundFundsAndPayload
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundFundsAndPayload` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can present source-chain fields in a format that maps to the wrong sender or asset once canonicalized.
- Invariant to test: canonicalization must not let one user-controlled formatting variant steal another asset or identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
