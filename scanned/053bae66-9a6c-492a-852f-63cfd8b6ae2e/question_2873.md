# Q2873: find-collateral-amount via liquidate-multi: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, drive `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
