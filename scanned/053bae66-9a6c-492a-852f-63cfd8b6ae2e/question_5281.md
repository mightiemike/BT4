# Q5281: is-healthy-with-mask via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) — which resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `is-healthy-with-mask` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
