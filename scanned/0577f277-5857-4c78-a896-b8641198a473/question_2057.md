# Q2057: Verification data is replayable across chains or account identities via Pre-Funded But Undeployed Uea / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in msgServer.RevertStuckInbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `msgServer.RevertStuckInbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so that it reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context, breaking the invariant that verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.RevertStuckInbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.RevertStuckInbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so it can reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context.
- Invariant to test: verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
