# Q3122: TSS vote validation accepts semantically impossible combinations via Tss Key Ids, Process / Message Is Directly Reachable in Params.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state when the message is directly reachable over normal transaction submission, and cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step, breaking the invariant that TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying, and resulting in Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/params.go::Params.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state
- Exploit idea: Cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
