# Q0319: add-user-collateral via transfer: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `transfer` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, then read `add-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
