# Q4328: resolve-pyth via supply-collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) varied, and assert that the value `resolve-pyth` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
