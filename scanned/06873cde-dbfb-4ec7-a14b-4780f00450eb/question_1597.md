# Q1597: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against validator tokens

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit just after validator token/share exchange rate changes, causing `validator tokens` to diverge so the invariant `incoming redelegation cannot be moved into the position to evade slash liability` fails and the attacker can mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch by testing the owner binding angle against `validator tokens` during `commit just after validator token/share exchange rate changes`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: incoming redelegation cannot be moved into the position to evade slash liability; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
