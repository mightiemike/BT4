# Q3019: is-healthy-with-mask via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `is-healthy-with-mask` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
