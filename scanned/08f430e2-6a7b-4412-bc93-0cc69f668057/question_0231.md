# Q231: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against distribution withdraw address

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator, causing `distribution withdraw address` to diverge so the invariant `position ownership and withdraw address remain bound to the delegator signer` fails and the attacker can use rounding to create a position that can claim rewards or voting power without locked value, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: use rounding to create a position that can claim rewards or voting power without locked value by testing the owner binding angle against `distribution withdraw address` during `commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: position ownership and withdraw address remain bound to the delegator signer; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
