# Q3346: iter-lookup-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
