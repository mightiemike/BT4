# Q2924: Target-id ambiguity applies one vote to the wrong process or migration via Direct Utss Message Submission / Gasless Admission Can Make in MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers when gasless admission can make repetition cheap, and cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it shape ids so a vote lands on a different record than intended, breaking the invariant that one TSS vote must map to exactly one intended process or migration, and resulting in Wrong TSS state causing direct loss or frozen funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_vote_fund_migration.go::MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can shape ids so a vote lands on a different record than intended.
- Invariant to test: one TSS vote must map to exactly one intended process or migration
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS state causing direct loss or frozen funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
