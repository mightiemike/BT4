# Q3275: Reverse PRC20 lookup resolves the wrong source asset via Chain Ids, Token Addresses, / Registry-Derived Semantics Affect Mint, in MigrateChainConfigs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows when registry-derived semantics affect mint, refund, revert, or outbound routing, and cause `MigrateChainConfigs` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make a user flow that should map one PRC20 back to another source-chain asset, breaking the invariant that one PRC20 address must resolve to exactly one canonical external asset configuration, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/migrations/v2/migrate.go::MigrateChainConfigs
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows
- Exploit idea: Cause `MigrateChainConfigs` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make a user flow that should map one PRC20 back to another source-chain asset.
- Invariant to test: one PRC20 address must resolve to exactly one canonical external asset configuration
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
