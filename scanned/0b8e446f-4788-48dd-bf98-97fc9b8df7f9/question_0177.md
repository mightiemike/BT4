# Q0177: sanitize can persist state that blocks later replay (meta.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `sanitize` in `accounts-db/src/append_vec/meta.rs` with a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not, and commit state through `sanitize` that a later load or restart refuses to accept, so that the invariant "Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/append_vec/meta.rs` -> `sanitize()` (around line 118)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not
- Exploit idea: Commit account/ledger state through `sanitize` that a later load rejects, so every node fails replay after restart and needs manual intervention.
- Invariant to test: Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Write the crafted state, restart the bank from it in a test, and assert replay completes.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
