# Q0562: get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent confuses account types or owners (bank.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` in `runtime/src/bank.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and have `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank.rs` -> `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent()` (around line 5163)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_program_accounts_modified_since_parent` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
