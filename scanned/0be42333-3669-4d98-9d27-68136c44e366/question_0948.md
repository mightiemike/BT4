# Q0948: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
