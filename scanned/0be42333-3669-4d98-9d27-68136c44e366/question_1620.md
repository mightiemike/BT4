# Q1620: accrue-collateral-asset via redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` of shares burned reach `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue-collateral-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
