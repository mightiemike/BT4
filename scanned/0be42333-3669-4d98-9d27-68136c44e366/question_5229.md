# Q5229: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `debt-amount`, drive `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) — which scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-liq-factor-bound` touches, run `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
