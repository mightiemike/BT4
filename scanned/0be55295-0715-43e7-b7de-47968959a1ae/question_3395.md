# Q3395: Ballot identity collision finalizes the wrong inbound variant via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Inbound Will Create Visible in Keeper.RecordInboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when the inbound will create a visible UTX even if execution validation fails, and cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds, breaking the invariant that one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/inbound.go::Keeper.RecordInboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds.
- Invariant to test: one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
