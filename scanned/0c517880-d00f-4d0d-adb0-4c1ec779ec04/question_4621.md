# Q4621: calc-treasury-lp-preview via transfer: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling `amount`, drive `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) — which divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `transfer` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with `amount`, then read `calc-treasury-lp-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
