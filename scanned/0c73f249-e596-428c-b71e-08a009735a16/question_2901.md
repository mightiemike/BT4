# Q2901: Height monotonicity can be bypassed around bootstrap boundaries via Cross-Chain Activity Whose Fees / First Write Stale Update in Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it submit a value that should be stale but is accepted because the state looks unbootstrapped or partially bootstrapped, breaking the invariant that chain heights must advance monotonically once a chain is live for users, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong outbound finality assumptions?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/gas_fee.go::Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can submit a value that should be stale but is accepted because the state looks unbootstrapped or partially bootstrapped.
- Invariant to test: chain heights must advance monotonically once a chain is live for users
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong outbound finality assumptions
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
