# Q1683: refresh via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `refresh` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
