# Q3018: resolve-dia via collateral-remove-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
