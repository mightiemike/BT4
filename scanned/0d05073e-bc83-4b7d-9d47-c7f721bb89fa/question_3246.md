# Q3246: process-debt-asset via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `process-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
