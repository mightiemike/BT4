# Q2957: resolve-interpolation-points via deposit: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `deposit` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
