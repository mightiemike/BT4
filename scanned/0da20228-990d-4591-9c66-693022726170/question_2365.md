# Q2365: total-assets via supply-collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) — which adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `total-assets` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
