# Q2092: sync-order dependent state via `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` (da_block_handler.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary, controlling the timing of proof versus commitment arrival, drive `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` in `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` so that the state a node reaches syncing from genesis and the state a node reaches syncing from a snapshot stop being the same, breaking the invariant that final state is independent of sync path?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` -> `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary
- Attacker controls: the timing of proof versus commitment arrival
- Exploit idea: sync-order dependent state - reach `insert_pending_commitment_if_not_exists` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the state a node reaches syncing from genesis and the state a node reaches syncing from a snapshot stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `ProcessingResult`, `ProofSource`, `L1BlockHandler`, `run`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: final state is independent of sync path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: sync both ways over the same range and diff roots
