# Q283: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against delegator account

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit to a tier while validator status or token-per-share rate changes in the same test sequence, causing `delegator account` to diverge so the invariant `tiny or rounded amounts cannot create claimable rewards without equivalent locked stake` fails and the attacker can set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `delegator account` during `commit to a tier while validator status or token-per-share rate changes in the same test sequence`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: tiny or rounded amounts cannot create claimable rewards without equivalent locked stake; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
