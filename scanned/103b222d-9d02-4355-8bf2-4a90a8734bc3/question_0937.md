# Q937: ClearPosition owner binding against LastBonusAccrual

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClearPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then clear exit around tier close-only update and attempt to keep a position alive, causing `LastBonusAccrual` to diverge so the invariant `only owner can clear exit state` fails and the attacker can clear an exit while unbonding exists and later withdraw or delegate the same funds twice, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClearPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClearPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, delegation state
- Exploit idea: clear an exit while unbonding exists and later withdraw or delegate the same funds twice by testing the owner binding angle against `LastBonusAccrual` during `clear exit around tier close-only update and attempt to keep a position alive`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: only owner can clear exit state; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state test for ClearPosition at pre-unlock, exact-unlock, and post-unlock times; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
