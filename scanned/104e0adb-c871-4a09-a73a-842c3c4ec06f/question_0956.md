# Q0956: accrue-user-debts via collateral-remove-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
