# Q1539: resolve-or-create via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-or-create` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
