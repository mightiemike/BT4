# Q0151: subset via repay: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) tests bitmask containment. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `repay` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `subset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
