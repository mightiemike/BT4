# Q5160: merge-price via supply-collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
