# Q2153: calc-utilization via collateral-remove: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) — which divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
