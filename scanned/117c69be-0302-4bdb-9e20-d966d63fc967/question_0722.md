# Q0722: Decimals or native-representation mismatch corrupts amount semantics via User-Controlled Inbound Outbound Forces / Wrong Lookup Would Not in TokenConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset when a wrong lookup would not be caught by offchain honesty alone, and cause `TokenConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it route a normal user deposit or refund through the wrong decimal or native-representation assumptions, breaking the invariant that registry amount semantics must preserve the same real asset quantity end to end, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/token_config.go::TokenConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset
- Exploit idea: Cause `TokenConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can route a normal user deposit or refund through the wrong decimal or native-representation assumptions.
- Invariant to test: registry amount semantics must preserve the same real asset quantity end to end
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
