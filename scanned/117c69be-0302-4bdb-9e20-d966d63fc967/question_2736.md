# Q2736: Address-formatting differences split one UV into two identities via Direct Msgupdateuniversalvalidator Related Uvalidator / Downstream Modules Trust Uv in Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message when downstream modules trust the UV identity for voting or offchain routing, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it cause one validator to appear under multiple equivalent identities across modules, breaking the invariant that one UV must map to one canonical identity in all modules, and resulting in Wrong finalization or frozen funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_universal_validator.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can cause one validator to appear under multiple equivalent identities across modules.
- Invariant to test: one UV must map to one canonical identity in all modules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization or frozen funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
