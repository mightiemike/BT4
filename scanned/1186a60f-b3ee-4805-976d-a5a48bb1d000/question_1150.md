# Q1150: create via transfer: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `transfer` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
