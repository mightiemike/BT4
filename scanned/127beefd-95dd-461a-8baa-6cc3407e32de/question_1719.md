# Q1719: Unprivileged chain-meta vote sets oracle-controlled fees via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it reach the vote path without already being an eligible UV and write attacker-chosen oracle inputs, breaking the invariant that only eligible UV votes should be able to influence chain meta and downstream gas accounting, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through wrong gas accounting?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/gas_fee.go::Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can reach the vote path without already being an eligible UV and write attacker-chosen oracle inputs.
- Invariant to test: only eligible UV votes should be able to influence chain meta and downstream gas accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through wrong gas accounting
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
