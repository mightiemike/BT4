# Q0182: write-feed via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `write-feed` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
