# Q0392: population via liquidate: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it counts set bits to order the bucket search, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `debt-amount` varied, and assert that the value `population` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
