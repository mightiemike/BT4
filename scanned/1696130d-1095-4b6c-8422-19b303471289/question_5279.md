# Q5279: iter-price-multi via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
