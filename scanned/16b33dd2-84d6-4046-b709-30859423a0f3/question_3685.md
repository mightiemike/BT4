# Q3685: Staleness handling pins an old chain height and freezes processing via Repeated Votes Vote Updates / Live User Flows Depend in Keeper.VoteChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic when live user flows depend on the stored gas-price and chain-height values, and cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire, breaking the invariant that stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.VoteChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire.
- Invariant to test: stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
