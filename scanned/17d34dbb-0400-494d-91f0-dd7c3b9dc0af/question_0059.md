# Q0059: collateral-add via repay: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `repay` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
