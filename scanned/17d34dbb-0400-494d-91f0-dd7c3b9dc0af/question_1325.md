# Q1325: calc-cumulative-debt via liquidate-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) — which multiplies scaled principal by an index — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
