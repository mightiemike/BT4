# Q0011: Ballot identity collision merges distinct observations via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Honest Uvs Later Vote in StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id, breaking the invariant that one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/staking_hooks.go::StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id.
- Invariant to test: one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
