# Q0151: Cross-namespace decoding ambiguity changes the executed payload via Hex Blobs Ambiguous Emptiness, / Payload Is Only Source in DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics when the payload is the only source of execution semantics for the inbound, and cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it make the same raw payload decode into a different semantic call than honest observers expect, breaking the invariant that raw payload decoding must have one deterministic interpretation for one source-chain namespace, and resulting in Unauthorized execution, direct fund loss, or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/decode_payload.go::DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can make the same raw payload decode into a different semantic call than honest observers expect.
- Invariant to test: raw payload decoding must have one deterministic interpretation for one source-chain namespace
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized execution, direct fund loss, or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
