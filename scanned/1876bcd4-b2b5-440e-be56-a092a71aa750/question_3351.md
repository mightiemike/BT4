# Q3351: chunk store poisoning across blocks via `citrea_network_to_chain_id` (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who grinds a reveal so its wtxid matches one an honest aggregate references, controlling the entire chunk body it inscribes, drive `citrea_network_to_chain_id` in `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/mod.rs` so that the chunk store contents an honest prover starts an L1 block with and the contents another honest prover starts with stop being the same, breaking the invariant that chunk-store state is a deterministic function of processed L1 blocks?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/mod.rs` -> `citrea_network_to_chain_id`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party grinds a reveal so its wtxid matches one an honest aggregate references
- Attacker controls: the entire chunk body it inscribes
- Exploit idea: chunk store poisoning across blocks - reach `citrea_network_to_chain_id` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the chunk store contents an honest prover starts an L1 block with and the contents another honest prover starts with stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `LightClientVerificationError`, `RunL1BlockResult`, `LightClientProofCircuit`, `verify_batch_proof_seq_comm_relation`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: chunk-store state is a deterministic function of processed L1 blocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - light client proof split: two honest provers commit different outputs for the same L1 block, attacking Clementine operators
- Fast validation: process the same L1 range in two nodes and diff the accessor state
