# Q3154: mask-update via supply-collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
