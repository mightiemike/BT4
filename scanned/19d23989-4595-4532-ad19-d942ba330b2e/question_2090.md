# Q2090: get_slot_hashes can be driven into unbounded work (sysvar_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_slot_hashes` in `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and make `get_slot_hashes` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `get_slot_hashes` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` -> `get_slot_hashes()` (around line 169)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `get_slot_hashes` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `get_slot_hashes` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `get_slot_hashes` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
