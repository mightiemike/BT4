# Q2324: Authz wrapping weakens TSS authority checks via Direct Utss Message Submission / Message Is Directly Reachable in msgServer.VoteFundMigration

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers when the message is directly reachable over normal transaction submission, and cause `msgServer.VoteFundMigration` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks, breaking the invariant that wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteFundMigration
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteFundMigration` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks.
- Invariant to test: wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
