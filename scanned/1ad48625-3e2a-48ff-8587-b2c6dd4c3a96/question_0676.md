# Q0676: unpack-u16 via redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` of shares burned reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `amount` of shares burned, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
