# Q1351: proof session reuse via `add_hint` (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who makes the proved range span a fork or method-id activation boundary, controlling the overlap between requested ranges, drive `add_hint` in `crates/risc0/src/host/mod.rs` so that the input a proving session was started for and the input its output is attributed to stop being the same, breaking the invariant that each proof output is bound to its input?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/risc0/src/host/mod.rs` -> `add_hint`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party makes the proved range span a fork or method-id activation boundary
- Attacker controls: the overlap between requested ranges
- Exploit idea: proof session reuse - reach `add_hint` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the input a proving session was started for and the input its output is attributed to stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `Risc0Host`, `Prover`, `simulate_with_hints`, `add_assumption`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: each proof output is bound to its input
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a batch/light-client proof accepted for a state transition that never happened (false claim proved)
- Fast validation: interleave sessions and assert attribution
