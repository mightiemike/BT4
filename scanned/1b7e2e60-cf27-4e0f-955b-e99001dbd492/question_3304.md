# Q3304: write-feed via supply-collateral-add: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
