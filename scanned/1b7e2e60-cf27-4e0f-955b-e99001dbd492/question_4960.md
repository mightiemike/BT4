# Q4960: get-notional-evaluation via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
