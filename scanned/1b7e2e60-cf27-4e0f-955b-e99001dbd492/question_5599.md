# Q5599: refresh via liquidate-multi: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `refresh` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
