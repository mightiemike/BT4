# Q1609: Ballot identity collision merges distinct observations via Observation Variants Differ Only / Attacker Can Generate Many in MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id, breaking the invariant that one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_remove_universal_validator.go::MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id.
- Invariant to test: one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
