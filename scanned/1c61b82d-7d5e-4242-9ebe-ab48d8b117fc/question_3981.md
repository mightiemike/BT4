# Q3981: Zero-amount payload inbound breaks deposit-before-execution assumptions via Two Logically Distinct Inbounds / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.ExecuteInbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Keeper.ExecuteInbound` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it use a zero-amount payload-capable tx type to execute logic that assumes funds or gas top-up happened first, breaking the invariant that payload execution must not obtain privileges or value effects that depend on a deposit that never occurred, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/execute_inbound.go::Keeper.ExecuteInbound
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecuteInbound` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can use a zero-amount payload-capable tx type to execute logic that assumes funds or gas top-up happened first.
- Invariant to test: payload execution must not obtain privileges or value effects that depend on a deposit that never occurred
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
