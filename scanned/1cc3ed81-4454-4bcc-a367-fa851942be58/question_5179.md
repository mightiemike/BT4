# Q5179: interpolate-rate via liquidate-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `interpolate-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
