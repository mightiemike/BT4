# Q1694: iter-lookup-collateral via supply-collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `iter-lookup-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
