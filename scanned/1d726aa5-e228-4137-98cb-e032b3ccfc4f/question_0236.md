# Q0236: next-index via collateral-remove: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
