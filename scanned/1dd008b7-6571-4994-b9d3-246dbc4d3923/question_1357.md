# Q1357: Bonded/tombstoned status races corrupt active-voter decisions via Direct Msgupdateuniversalvalidator Related Uvalidator / Mutated Identity Would Affect in Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message when the mutated identity would affect live cross-chain flows, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it time attacker-created flows so the protocol reads a stale UV status at a security-critical moment, breaking the invariant that active-voter eligibility must not diverge across one observation lifecycle, and resulting in Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_universal_validator.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can time attacker-created flows so the protocol reads a stale UV status at a security-critical moment.
- Invariant to test: active-voter eligibility must not diverge across one observation lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
