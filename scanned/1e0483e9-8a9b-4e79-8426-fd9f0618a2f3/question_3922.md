# Q3922: merge-price via collateral-remove-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
