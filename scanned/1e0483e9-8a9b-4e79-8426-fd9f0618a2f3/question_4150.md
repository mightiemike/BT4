# Q4150: find-superset via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
