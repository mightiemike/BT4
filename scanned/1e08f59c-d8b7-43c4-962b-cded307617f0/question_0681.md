# Q681: AddToTierPosition owner binding against reward checkpoints

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.AddToTierPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then add funds while validator events are pending and compare rewards before and after setPosition, causing `reward checkpoints` to diverge so the invariant `min-lock and tier close-only rules cannot be bypassed through additions` fails and the attacker can lock owner funds to an incorrect delegator account and later sweep them through withdrawal, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.AddToTierPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgAddToTierPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, validator exchange rate
- Exploit idea: lock owner funds to an incorrect delegator account and later sweep them through withdrawal by testing the owner binding angle against `reward checkpoints` during `add funds while validator events are pending and compare rewards before and after setPosition`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: min-lock and tier close-only rules cannot be bypassed through additions; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over AddToTierPosition, claimRewards, delegate, and position state conversion; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
