# Q2396: accrue-and-cache via call-ststx-ratio: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `accrue-and-cache` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
