# Q3239: find-superset via borrow: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `borrow` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
