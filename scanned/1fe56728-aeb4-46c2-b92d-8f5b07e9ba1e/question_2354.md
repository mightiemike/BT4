# Q2354: lookup via liquidate: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `liquidate` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `lookup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
