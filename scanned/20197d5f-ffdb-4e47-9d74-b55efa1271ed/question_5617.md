# Q5617: principal-ratio-reduction via accrue: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) — which derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `accrue` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, then read `principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
