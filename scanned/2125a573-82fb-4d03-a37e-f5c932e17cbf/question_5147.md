# Q5147: system event ordering versus user txs via `init_module` (genesis.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA, controlling the target system-contract address and selector, drive `init_module` in `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` so that the position system events occupy in the block and the position the STF assumes stop being the same, breaking the invariant that system events are first-class and fixed in order?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` -> `init_module`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA
- Attacker controls: the target system-contract address and selector
- Exploit idea: system event ordering versus user txs - reach `init_module` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the position system events occupy in the block and the position the STF assumes stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `AccountData`, `AccountDataHelper`, `EvmConfig`, `empty_code`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: system events are first-class and fixed in order
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: interleave and re-execute the block
