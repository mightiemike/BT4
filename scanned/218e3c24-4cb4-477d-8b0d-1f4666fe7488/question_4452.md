# Q4452: calc-liq-factor via liquidate-multi: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
