# Q4646: linear-interpolate via deposit: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `deposit` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
