# Q2682: from_sharable_transaction_batch_region lets attacker data change the committed hash (transaction_ptr.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `from_sharable_transaction_batch_region` in `scheduling-utils/src/transaction_ptr.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the dedup filter's view of a packet disagree with the packet that reaches banking, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `scheduling-utils/src/transaction_ptr.rs` -> `from_sharable_transaction_batch_region()` (around line 121)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `from_sharable_transaction_batch_region` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
