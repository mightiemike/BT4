# Q3096: Wrong chain-meta values distort refund or gas-fee settlement via Gasless Msgvotechainmeta Submission If / Chain Will Later Use in Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed when the chain will later use the medianed values to quote or refund gas, and cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows, breaking the invariant that gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows.
- Invariant to test: gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
