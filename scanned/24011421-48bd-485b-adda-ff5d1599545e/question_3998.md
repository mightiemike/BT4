# Q3998: is-healthy-with-mask via borrow: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `borrow` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `is-healthy-with-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
