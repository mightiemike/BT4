# Q3464: delete-then-read semantics via `get_last_pruned_l2_height` (scratchpad.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who sends a transaction that writes, deletes and rewrites the same storage key in one block, controlling which JMT keys are read and written, drive `get_last_pruned_l2_height` in `crates/sovereign-sdk/module-system/sov-modules-core/src/storage/scratchpad.rs` so that the value observed after a delete in-block and the value the JMT commits stop being consistent, breaking the invariant that deletes are visible identically natively and in-circuit?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sovereign-sdk/module-system/sov-modules-core/src/storage/scratchpad.rs` -> `get_last_pruned_l2_height`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party sends a transaction that writes, deletes and rewrites the same storage key in one block
- Attacker controls: which JMT keys are read and written
- Exploit idea: delete-then-read semantics - reach `get_last_pruned_l2_height` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the value observed after a delete in-block and the value the JMT commits stop being consistent; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `StateReaderAndWriter`, `StateDelta`, `AccessoryDelta`, `OffchainDelta`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: deletes are visible identically natively and in-circuit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: write/delete/read the same key and diff roots
