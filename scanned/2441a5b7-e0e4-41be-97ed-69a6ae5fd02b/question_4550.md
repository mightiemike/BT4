# Q4550: send-tokens via repay: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `repay` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
