# Q0867: Payload execution emits outbounds under the wrong ownership context via Payload Fields Such As / Target Uea Already Holds in Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it make outbound-producing execution run as though it belonged to a different user or UTX, breaking the invariant that outbound creation must remain bound to the exact authorized payload and account context, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/evm.go::Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can make outbound-producing execution run as though it belonged to a different user or UTX.
- Invariant to test: outbound creation must remain bound to the exact authorized payload and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of bridged funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
