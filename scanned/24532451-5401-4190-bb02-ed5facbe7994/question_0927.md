# Q0927: Vote storage growth or duplicate handling becomes a block-time DoS via Repeated Votes Vote Updates / Live User Flows Depend in Keeper.VoteChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic when live user flows depend on the stored gas-price and chain-height values, and cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth, breaking the invariant that publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.VoteChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth.
- Invariant to test: publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
