# Q5426: uint-to-list-u64 via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `uint-to-list-u64` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
