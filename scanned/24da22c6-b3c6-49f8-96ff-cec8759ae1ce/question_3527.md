# Q3527: iter-price-multi via call-ststx-ratio: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `call-ststx-ratio` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
