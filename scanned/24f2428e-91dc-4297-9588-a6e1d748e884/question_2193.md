# Q2193: Eligible-voter snapshot drifts away from the observation lifecycle via Observation Variants Differ Only / Honest Uvs Later Vote in Ballot.ShouldPass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `Ballot.ShouldPass` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation, breaking the invariant that ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set, and resulting in Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.ShouldPass
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.ShouldPass` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation.
- Invariant to test: ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
