# Q0960: get-position via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `get-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
