# Q4317: accrue-user-collateral via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) — which accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-collateral` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
