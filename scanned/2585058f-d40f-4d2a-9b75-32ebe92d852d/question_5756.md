# Q5756: find-debt-scaled via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `find-debt-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
