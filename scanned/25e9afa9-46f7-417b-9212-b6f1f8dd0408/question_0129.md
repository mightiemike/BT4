# Q129: LockTier owner binding against distribution withdraw address

## Question
Can unprivileged owner account enter through `msgServer.LockTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then lock funds into a fresh position and immediately use authz or feegrant to exercise owner-controlled follow-up messages, causing `distribution withdraw address` to diverge so the invariant `reward checkpoints begin at the validator's latest event sequence and cannot include pre-position rewards` fails and the attacker can capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.LockTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgLockTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator by testing the owner binding angle against `distribution withdraw address` during `lock funds into a fresh position and immediately use authz or feegrant to exercise owner-controlled follow-up messages`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: reward checkpoints begin at the validator's latest event sequence and cannot include pre-position rewards; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test around LockTier plus bank, staking, distribution, and tieredrewards stores; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
