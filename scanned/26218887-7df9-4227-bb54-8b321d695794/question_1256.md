# Q1256: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against owner balance

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then withdraw after ClearPosition attempts and pending reward claims, causing `owner balance` to diverge so the invariant `position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal` fails and the attacker can sweep coins from a reused or incorrectly aliased position delegator address, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: sweep coins from a reused or incorrectly aliased position delegator address by testing the owner binding angle against `owner balance` during `withdraw after ClearPosition attempts and pending reward claims`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
