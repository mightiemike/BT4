# Q3179: Ballot identity collision merges distinct observations via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Variant Handling Is Only in Ballot.ShouldReject

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when variant handling is the only guard against semantic collisions, and cause `Ballot.ShouldReject` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id, breaking the invariant that one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.ShouldReject
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.ShouldReject` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id.
- Invariant to test: one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
