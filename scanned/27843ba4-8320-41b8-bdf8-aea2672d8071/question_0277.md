# Q0277: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) — which calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `accrue-debt-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
