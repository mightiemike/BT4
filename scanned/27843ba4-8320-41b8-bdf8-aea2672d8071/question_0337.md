# Q0337: find-asset via liquidate-multi: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) — which returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic` — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `find-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
