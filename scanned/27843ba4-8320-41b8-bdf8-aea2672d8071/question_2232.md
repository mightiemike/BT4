# Q2232: add-user-collateral via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `add-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
