# Q5282: gas limit versus L1 fee at the block edge via `set_tx_info` (handler.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who chains nested frames that touch balances, gas refunds and access lists in one transaction, controlling revert timing inside the frame, drive `set_tx_info` in `crates/evm/src/evm/handler.rs` so that the gas the block accounts for and the gas its transactions consumed stop being equal, breaking the invariant that block gas accounting is exact?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/evm/handler.rs` -> `set_tx_info`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party chains nested frames that touch balances, gas refunds and access lists in one transaction
- Attacker controls: revert timing inside the frame
- Exploit idea: gas limit versus L1 fee at the block edge - reach `set_tx_info` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the gas the block accounts for and the gas its transactions consumed stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `TxInfo`, `CitreaChainExt`, `CitreaChain`, `CitreaCallExt`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: block gas accounting is exact
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: fill a block to the limit with L1-fee-heavy transactions and re-execute
