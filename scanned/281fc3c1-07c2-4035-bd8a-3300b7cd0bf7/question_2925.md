# Q2925: resolve-ststx via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, drive `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) — which calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down` — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-ststx` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
