# Q0303: accrue-user-debts via redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-debts` touches, run `redeem` with `recipient`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
