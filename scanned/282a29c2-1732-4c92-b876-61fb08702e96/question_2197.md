# Q2197: get-cached-indexes via call-ststx-ratio: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) — which reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, then read `get-cached-indexes` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
