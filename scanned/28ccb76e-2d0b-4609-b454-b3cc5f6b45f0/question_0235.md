# Q0235: Duplicate vote handling counts one actor twice effectively via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Attacker Can Generate Many in MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once, breaking the invariant that each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator_status.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once.
- Invariant to test: each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
