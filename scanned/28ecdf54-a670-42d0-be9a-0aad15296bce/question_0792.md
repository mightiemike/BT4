# Q0792: oracle-last-update via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `oracle-last-update` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
