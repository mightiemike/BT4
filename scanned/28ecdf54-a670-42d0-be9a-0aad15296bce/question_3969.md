# Q3969: next-index via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) — which returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-index` touches, run `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
