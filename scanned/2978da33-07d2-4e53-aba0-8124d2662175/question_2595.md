# Q2595: zip via liquidate-multi: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `zip` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
