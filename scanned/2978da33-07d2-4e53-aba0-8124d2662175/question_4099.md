# Q4099: resolve-ststx via call-ststx-ratio: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, then read `resolve-ststx` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
