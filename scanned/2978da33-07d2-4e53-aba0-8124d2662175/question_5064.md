# Q5064: accrue-collateral-asset via deposit: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call reach `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `deposit` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `accrue-collateral-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
