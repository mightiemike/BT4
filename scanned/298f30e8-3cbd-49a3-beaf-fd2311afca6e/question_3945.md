# Q3945: create via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) — which binds a principal to a fresh numeric id — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `create` touches, run `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
