# Q2357: Address or owner validation uses the wrong namespace assumptions via Caip-2 Identifiers, Addresses, Amounts, / Later Execution Assumes Basic in UniversalTx.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with CAIP-2 identifiers, addresses, amounts, enums, signatures, or status fields accepted by the type when later execution assumes basic validation already ruled the dangerous case out, and cause `UniversalTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another, breaking the invariant that address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/universal_tx.go::UniversalTx.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: CAIP-2 identifiers, addresses, amounts, enums, signatures, or status fields accepted by the type
- Exploit idea: Cause `UniversalTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another.
- Invariant to test: address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
