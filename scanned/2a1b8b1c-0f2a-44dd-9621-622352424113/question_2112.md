# Q2112: L1 reorg handling via `run` (da_block_handler.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary, controlling what a syncing node sees first, drive `run` in `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` so that the L2 state a node holds after a reorg and the state implied by the canonical L1 chain stop being the same, breaking the invariant that reorg handling restores the canonical view?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` -> `run`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes conflicting commitments and proofs across an L1 reorg boundary
- Attacker controls: what a syncing node sees first
- Exploit idea: L1 reorg handling - reach `run` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the L2 state a node holds after a reorg and the state implied by the canonical L1 chain stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `ProcessingResult`, `ProofSource`, `L1BlockHandler`, `process_queued_l1_blocks`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: reorg handling restores the canonical view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: reorg beneath processed commitments and assert convergence
