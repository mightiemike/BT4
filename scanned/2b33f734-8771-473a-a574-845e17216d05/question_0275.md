# Q0275: get_header is not deterministic across nodes (bucket_storage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `get_header` in `bucket_map/src/bucket_storage.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make the ref count tracked for a storage entry disagree with the number of live index entries pointing at it, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_header` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket_storage.rs` -> `get_header()` (around line 321)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_header` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_header` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_header` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
