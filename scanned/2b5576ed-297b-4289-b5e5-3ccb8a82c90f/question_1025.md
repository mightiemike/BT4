# Q1025: Pending-inbound cleanup gap enables duplicate or blocked execution via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Failed Inbound Should Still in Keeper.RevertStuckInbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `Keeper.RevertStuckInbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so that it leave a finalized or failed inbound in pending state long enough to be replayed or to block the legitimate lifecycle, breaking the invariant that pending-inbound indexes must advance atomically with UTX creation and execution outcomes, and resulting in Direct loss of funds or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/admin_revert.go::Keeper.RevertStuckInbound
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RevertStuckInbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so it can leave a finalized or failed inbound in pending state long enough to be replayed or to block the legitimate lifecycle.
- Invariant to test: pending-inbound indexes must advance atomically with UTX creation and execution outcomes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss of funds or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
