# Q2215: refresh via collateral-remove: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `refresh` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
