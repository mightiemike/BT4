# Q4488: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `collateral-receiver` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `calc-liquidation-params` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
