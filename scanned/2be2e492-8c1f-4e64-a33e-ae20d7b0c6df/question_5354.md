# Q5354: vault-accrue via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
