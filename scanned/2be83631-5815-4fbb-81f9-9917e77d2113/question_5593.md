# Q5593: system-repay via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) — which splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid` — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
