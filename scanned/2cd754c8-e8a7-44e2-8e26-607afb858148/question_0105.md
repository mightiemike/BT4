# Q0105: resolve-pyth via liquidate-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) — which reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-pyth` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
