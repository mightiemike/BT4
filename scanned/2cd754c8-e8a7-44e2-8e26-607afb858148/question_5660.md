# Q5660: oracle-last-update via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `oracle-last-update` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
