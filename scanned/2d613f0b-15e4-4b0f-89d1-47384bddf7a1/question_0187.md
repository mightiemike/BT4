# Q0187: is_hash_valid_for_age is not deterministic across nodes (blockhash_queue.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `is_hash_valid_for_age` in `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the zero-lamport accounts filtered during clean disagree with the accounts still reachable through the index, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `is_hash_valid_for_age` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` -> `is_hash_valid_for_age()` (around line 98)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `is_hash_valid_for_age` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `is_hash_valid_for_age` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `is_hash_valid_for_age` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
