# Q3006: Payload-carrying inbound spawns the wrong outbound context via Two Logically Distinct Inbounds / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Inbound.ValidateForExecution

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Inbound.ValidateForExecution` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction, breaking the invariant that outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.ValidateForExecution
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.ValidateForExecution` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction.
- Invariant to test: outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
