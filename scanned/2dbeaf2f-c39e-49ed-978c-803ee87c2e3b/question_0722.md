# Q0722: principal-ratio-reduction via accrue: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `accrue` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
