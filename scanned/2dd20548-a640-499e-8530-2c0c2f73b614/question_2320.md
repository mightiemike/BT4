# Q2320: MintNFT owner binding against token id uniqueness

## Question
Can denom owner or authz grantee enter through `msgServer.MintNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, focusing on owner index membership, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then mint then transfer and burn with the same token id across owner indexes, causing `token id uniqueness` to diverge so the invariant `token id is unique inside the denom and indexed under exactly one owner` fails and the attacker can create inconsistent owner indexes that allow duplicate transfers or burns, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.MintNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgMintNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, Name, URI, Data
- Exploit idea: create inconsistent owner indexes that allow duplicate transfers or burns by testing the owner binding angle against `token id uniqueness` during `mint then transfer and burn with the same token id across owner indexes`, with specific focus on owner index membership.
- Invariant to test: token id is unique inside the denom and indexed under exactly one owner; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over MintNFT, collection indexes, owner indexes, and authz signer path; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
