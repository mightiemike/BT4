# Q0463: resolve-interpolation-points via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, then read `resolve-interpolation-points` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
