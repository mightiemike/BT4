# Q3629: add-user-collateral via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) — which adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
