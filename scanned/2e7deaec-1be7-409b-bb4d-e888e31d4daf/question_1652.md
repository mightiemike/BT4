# Q1652: next-index via deposit: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `deposit` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with `recipient`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
