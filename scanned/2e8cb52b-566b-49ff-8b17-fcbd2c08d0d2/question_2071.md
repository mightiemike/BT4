# Q2071: Verification data is replayable across chains or account identities via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context, breaking the invariant that verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_migrate_uea.go::MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context.
- Invariant to test: verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
