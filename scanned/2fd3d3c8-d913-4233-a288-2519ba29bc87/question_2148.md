# Q2148: total-supply-preview via deposit: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `deposit` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `total-supply-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
