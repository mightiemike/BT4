# Q0265: aggregate referencing its own wtxid via `citrea_network_to_chain_id` (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes a `DataOnDa::Chunk` blob from an unknown key (no sender check exists on that path), controlling the order in which chunks land in the block, drive `citrea_network_to_chain_id` in `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/mod.rs` so that the chunk graph the aggregate walks and an acyclic set of distinct chunks stop being the same, breaking the invariant that aggregate resolution terminates on distinct chunks?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/mod.rs` -> `citrea_network_to_chain_id`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes a `DataOnDa::Chunk` blob from an unknown key (no sender check exists on that path)
- Attacker controls: the order in which chunks land in the block
- Exploit idea: aggregate referencing its own wtxid - reach `citrea_network_to_chain_id` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the chunk graph the aggregate walks and an acyclic set of distinct chunks stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `LightClientVerificationError`, `RunL1BlockResult`, `LightClientProofCircuit`, `verify_batch_proof_seq_comm_relation`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: aggregate resolution terminates on distinct chunks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - light client proof split: two honest provers commit different outputs for the same L1 block, attacking Clementine operators
- Fast validation: self-reference an aggregate wtxid and assert a clean refusal
