# Q0773: partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block breaks lamport conservation (slot_params.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block` in `runtime/src/slot_params.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and make the lamports `partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/slot_params.rs` -> `partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block()` (around line 84)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Drive `partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `partitioned_epoch_rewards_stake_account_stores_per_block`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
