# Q821: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against ExitUnlockAt

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then trigger exit just before tier update or close-only transition and attempt follow-up actions, causing `ExitUnlockAt` to diverge so the invariant `only the owner can set ExitUnlockAt for the position` fails and the attacker can make exit state diverge between Position and PositionState used by later functions, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: make exit state diverge between Position and PositionState used by later functions by testing the owner binding angle against `ExitUnlockAt` during `trigger exit just before tier update or close-only transition and attempt follow-up actions`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: only the owner can set ExitUnlockAt for the position; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
