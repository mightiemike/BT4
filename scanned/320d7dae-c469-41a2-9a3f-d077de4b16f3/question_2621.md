# Q2621: calc-index-next via collateral-remove: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
