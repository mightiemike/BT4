# Q0926: accrue-and-cache via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `accrue-and-cache` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
