# Q5581: remove-user-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) — which deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), then read `remove-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
