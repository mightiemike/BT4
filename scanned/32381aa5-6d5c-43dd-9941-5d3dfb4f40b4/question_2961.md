# Q2961: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Observation Variants Differ Only / Honest Uvs Later Vote in msgServer.UpdateParams

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.UpdateParams
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
