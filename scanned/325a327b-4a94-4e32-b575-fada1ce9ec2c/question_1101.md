# Q1101: ClaimTierRewards owner binding against RewardsPoolName balance

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClaimTierRewards` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim the same position across multiple calls with reordered position IDs, causing `RewardsPoolName balance` to diverge so the invariant `RewardsPoolName cannot pay more bonus coins than accrued and available` fails and the attacker can drain reward pool by exploiting event reference counts or checkpoint updates, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClaimTierRewards
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClaimTierRewards transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, claim batching
- Exploit idea: drain reward pool by exploiting event reference counts or checkpoint updates by testing the owner binding angle against `RewardsPoolName balance` during `claim the same position across multiple calls with reordered position IDs`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: RewardsPoolName cannot pay more bonus coins than accrued and available; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz/state-machine test over ClaimTierRewards with validator events and repeated batches; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
