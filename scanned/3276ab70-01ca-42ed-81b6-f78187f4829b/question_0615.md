# Q615: AddToTierPosition owner binding against LastBonusAccrual

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.AddToTierPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then attempt add after trigger exit and then clear exit in the same scenario, causing `LastBonusAccrual` to diverge so the invariant `positions in triggered exit cannot receive more locked funds` fails and the attacker can corrupt reward checkpoints so base or bonus rewards are paid twice, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.AddToTierPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgAddToTierPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, validator exchange rate
- Exploit idea: corrupt reward checkpoints so base or bonus rewards are paid twice by testing the owner binding angle against `LastBonusAccrual` during `attempt add after trigger exit and then clear exit in the same scenario`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: positions in triggered exit cannot receive more locked funds; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over AddToTierPosition, claimRewards, delegate, and position state conversion; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
