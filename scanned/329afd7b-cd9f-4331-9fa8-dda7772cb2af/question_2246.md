# Q2246: big_mod_exp_mult_complexity panics on attacker-reachable input (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `big_mod_exp_mult_complexity` in `syscalls/src/lib.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `big_mod_exp_mult_complexity`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `syscalls/src/lib.rs` -> `big_mod_exp_mult_complexity()` (around line 2303)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Reach `big_mod_exp_mult_complexity` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `big_mod_exp_mult_complexity` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
