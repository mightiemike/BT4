# Q2588: Canonicalization collapses safe and unsafe variants into one tally via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Honest Uvs Later Vote in Ballot.ShouldReject

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `Ballot.ShouldReject` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it change formatting-sensitive fields until honest voters appear to agree on different semantics, breaking the invariant that variant handling must preserve every field that changes execution outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.ShouldReject
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.ShouldReject` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can change formatting-sensitive fields until honest voters appear to agree on different semantics.
- Invariant to test: variant handling must preserve every field that changes execution outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
