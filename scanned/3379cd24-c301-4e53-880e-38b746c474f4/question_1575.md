# Q1575: calc-index-next via liquidate-multi: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) applies a multiplier to the current index. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
