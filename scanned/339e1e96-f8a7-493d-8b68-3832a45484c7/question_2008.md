# Q2008: Quorum recompute revives or flips a terminal ballot incorrectly via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Attacker Can Generate Many in MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result, breaking the invariant that terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator_status.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result.
- Invariant to test: terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
