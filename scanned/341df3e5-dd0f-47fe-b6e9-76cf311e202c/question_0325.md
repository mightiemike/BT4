# Q325: TierUndelegate owner binding against delegator spendable balance

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TierUndelegate` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim rewards through TierUndelegate while validator events include bond, unbond, and slash changes, causing `delegator spendable balance` to diverge so the invariant `base and bonus rewards are claimed once before delegation shares leave the position` fails and the attacker can make unbonded funds spendable by a derived account path not controlled by the owner, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TierUndelegate
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTierUndelegate transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, validator state
- Exploit idea: make unbonded funds spendable by a derived account path not controlled by the owner by testing the owner binding angle against `delegator spendable balance` during `claim rewards through TierUndelegate while validator events include bond, unbond, and slash changes`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: base and bonus rewards are claimed once before delegation shares leave the position; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state-machine test over TriggerExitFromTier, TierUndelegate, staking unbonding, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
