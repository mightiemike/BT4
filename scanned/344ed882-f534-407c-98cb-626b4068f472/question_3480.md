# Q3480: ParseClassTrace IsAwayFromOrigin RemoveClassPrefix IBCClassID source sink direction against escrow address selection

## Question
Can NFT sender or IBC packet sender enter through `ParseClassTrace / IsAwayFromOrigin / RemoveClassPrefix / IBCClassID` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling class id path, port ids, channel ids, ibc hash, focusing on class trace hash identity, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then return a voucher through the inverse channel path and remove prefix, causing `escrow address selection` to diverge so the invariant `class trace hash uniquely binds the exact path and base class id` fails and the attacker can make native and voucher class ids alias in lookup logic and bypass backing assumptions, leading to Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/types/trace.go::ParseClassTrace / IsAwayFromOrigin / RemoveClassPrefix / IBCClassID
- Entrypoint: MsgTransfer and IBC receive/refund class-id handling
- Attacker controls: class id path, port ids, channel ids, ibc hash, base class id
- Exploit idea: make native and voucher class ids alias in lookup logic and bypass backing assumptions by testing the source sink direction angle against `escrow address selection` during `return a voucher through the inverse channel path and remove prefix`, with specific focus on class trace hash identity.
- Invariant to test: class trace hash uniquely binds the exact path and base class id; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: unit and keeper tests over trace parsing plus full SendTransfer/OnRecvPacket round trips; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
