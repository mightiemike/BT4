# Q879: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against exit triggered flag

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on reward checkpoint monotonicity, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then trigger exit on a slashed or zero-share position and attempt withdrawal, causing `exit triggered flag` to diverge so the invariant `triggered exit blocks AddToTierPosition but still preserves owner-only claim rights` fails and the attacker can set or reset ExitUnlockAt to an earlier value and withdraw locked stake early, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: set or reset ExitUnlockAt to an earlier value and withdraw locked stake early by testing the owner binding angle against `exit triggered flag` during `trigger exit on a slashed or zero-share position and attempt withdrawal`, with specific focus on reward checkpoint monotonicity.
- Invariant to test: triggered exit blocks AddToTierPosition but still preserves owner-only claim rights; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
