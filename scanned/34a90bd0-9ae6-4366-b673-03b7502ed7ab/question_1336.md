# Q1336: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against withdraw address routing

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then withdraw after ClearPosition attempts and pending reward claims, causing `withdraw address routing` to diverge so the invariant `delegator dust cannot include unrelated user or module funds unless intentionally sent and owner-bound` fails and the attacker can leave reward routing after deletion and redirect future distribution rewards, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: leave reward routing after deletion and redirect future distribution rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `withdraw address routing` during `withdraw after ClearPosition attempts and pending reward claims`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: delegator dust cannot include unrelated user or module funds unless intentionally sent and owner-bound; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
