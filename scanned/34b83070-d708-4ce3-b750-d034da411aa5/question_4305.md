# Q4305: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) — which rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64` — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `filter-out-debt-asset` touches, run `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
