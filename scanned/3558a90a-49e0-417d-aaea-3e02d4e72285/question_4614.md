# Q4614: blob size threshold split via `get_commitment` (service.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who submits transactions that land in the last L2 block before a sequencer commitment is produced, controlling reorg depth achievable with valid Bitcoin transactions, drive `get_commitment` in `crates/sequencer/src/commitment/service.rs` so that the L2 blocks packed into a commitment blob and the blocks the commitment claims stop being the same set, breaking the invariant that chunking never changes commitment contents?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sequencer/src/commitment/service.rs` -> `get_commitment`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party submits transactions that land in the last L2 block before a sequencer commitment is produced
- Attacker controls: reorg depth achievable with valid Bitcoin transactions
- Exploit idea: blob size threshold split - reach `get_commitment` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the L2 blocks packed into a commitment blob and the blocks the commitment claims stop being the same set; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `CommitmentService`, `run`, `commit`, `store_commitments_from_da`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: chunking never changes commitment contents
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - forged DA inclusion/completeness: a blob hidden from or injected into the proved block set
- Fast validation: produce a commitment at the size threshold and re-parse it
