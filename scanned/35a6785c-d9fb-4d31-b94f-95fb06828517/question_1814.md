# Q1814: Ballot identity collision finalizes the wrong inbound variant via Two Logically Distinct Inbounds / Honest Uvs Later Finalize in Keeper.ExecuteInbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting when honest UVs later finalize whatever canonical observation wins, and cause `Keeper.ExecuteInbound` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds, breaking the invariant that one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/execute_inbound.go::Keeper.ExecuteInbound
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecuteInbound` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds.
- Invariant to test: one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
