# Q0732: Observed chain id confusion writes meta under the wrong chain via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it cause a user-relevant chain to consume another chain's gas-price or height data, breaking the invariant that chain meta must be namespaced so one chain's oracle data cannot affect another, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can cause a user-relevant chain to consume another chain's gas-price or height data.
- Invariant to test: chain meta must be namespaced so one chain's oracle data cannot affect another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
