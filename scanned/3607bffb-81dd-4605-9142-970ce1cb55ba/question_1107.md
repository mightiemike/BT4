# Q1107: interpolate-rate via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
