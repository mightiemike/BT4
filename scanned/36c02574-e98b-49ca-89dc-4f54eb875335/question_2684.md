# Q2684: calc-liq-factor-exp via liquidate-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `calc-liq-factor-exp` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708` -> `calc-liq-factor-exp`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-factor-exp` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
