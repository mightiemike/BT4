# Q3098: context-binding failure in Params.class-level path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use /wallet/broadcasthex so crypto/src/main/java/org/tron/common/crypto/zksnark/Params.java::class-level path verifies a signature, proof, or derivation against the wrong context, amount, contract, or owner, letting the wrong actor authorize a spend and leading to Signature, address, or proof confusion that lets the wrong actor authorize or spend?

## Target
- File/function: crypto/src/main/java/org/tron/common/crypto/zksnark/Params.java::class-level path
- Entrypoint: /wallet/broadcasthex
- Attacker controls: byte arrays, hex/base58/bech32 strings, signatures, proofs, hashes, derivation inputs, and address encoding flags
- Exploit idea: Stress domain-separation inputs, chain or contract identifiers, amount fields, and any split between the signed/proven data and the executed data.
- Invariant to test: Every signature, proof, or derivation result must be bound to one exact context, value, and owner before it can authorize state change.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Signature, address, or proof confusion that lets the wrong actor authorize or spend
- Fast validation: Construct pairs of requests that share a proof/signature under one context but differ under another via /wallet/broadcasthex; assert the proof cannot migrate across contexts.
