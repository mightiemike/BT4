# Q3990: convert-to-assets-preview via liquidate-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `convert-to-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
