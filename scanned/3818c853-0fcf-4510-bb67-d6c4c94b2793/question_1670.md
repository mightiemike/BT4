# Q1670: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-remove-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
