# Q3775: population via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) counts set bits to order the bucket search. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), then read `population` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
