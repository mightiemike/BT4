# Q1625: UTX identity collision merges distinct deposits via Source-Chain Fields Such As / Failed Inbound Should Still in Inbound.NormalizeForTxType

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload` when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so that it make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another, breaking the invariant that each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.NormalizeForTxType
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so it can make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another.
- Invariant to test: each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
