# Q3720: Stale process finalization overwrites the active key via Process Ids, Event Ids, / Attacker Can Create More in TssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with process ids, event ids, key ids, or chain ids consumed when TSS state transitions finalize when the attacker can create more than one related flow over time, and cause `TssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it cause an old or parallel process to become authoritative after a newer state already exists, breaking the invariant that only the one correct active TSS process should be able to define the active key, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/tss_key_process.go::TssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: process ids, event ids, key ids, or chain ids consumed when TSS state transitions finalize
- Exploit idea: Cause `TssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can cause an old or parallel process to become authoritative after a newer state already exists.
- Invariant to test: only the one correct active TSS process should be able to define the active key
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
