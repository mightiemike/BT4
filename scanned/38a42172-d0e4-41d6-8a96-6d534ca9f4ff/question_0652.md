# Q0652: Failed outbound remint credits the wrong recipient or asset via Multiple Outbounds Emitted From / Terminal Status Should Be in Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromPCTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with multiple outbounds emitted from one payload or receipt when terminal status should be reached exactly once, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromPCTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it drive the revert path so re-minted value goes to the wrong address or PRC20, breaking the invariant that a failed outbound must restore exactly the original rightful value to exactly the intended recovery recipient, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/create_outbound.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromPCTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: multiple outbounds emitted from one payload or receipt
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromPCTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can drive the revert path so re-minted value goes to the wrong address or PRC20.
- Invariant to test: a failed outbound must restore exactly the original rightful value to exactly the intended recovery recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
