# Q2854: UEA address resolution collides across attacker-chosen account fields via Payload Fields Such As / Payload Can Emit Receipt in MigrateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the payload can emit receipt logs that create outbounds or rescues, and cause `MigrateUniversalTx` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it cause two distinct universal accounts to resolve to one execution address or one account to resolve inconsistently, breaking the invariant that universal account identity must map injectively to one UEA address, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/migrations/v4/migrate.go::MigrateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `MigrateUniversalTx` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can cause two distinct universal accounts to resolve to one execution address or one account to resolve inconsistently.
- Invariant to test: universal account identity must map injectively to one UEA address
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
