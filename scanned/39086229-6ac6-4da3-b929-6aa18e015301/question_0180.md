# Q0180: accrue-user-collateral via repay: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `repay` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
