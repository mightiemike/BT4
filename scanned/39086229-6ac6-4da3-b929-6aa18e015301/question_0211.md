# Q0211: accrue-collateral-asset via repay: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `repay` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `accrue-collateral-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
