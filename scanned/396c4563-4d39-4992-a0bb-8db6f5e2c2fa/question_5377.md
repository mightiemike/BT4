# Q5377: filter-u128 via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) — which filters a 128-entry bucket list — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `filter-u128` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
