# Q0058: load_without_fixed_root can be driven into unbounded work (accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `load_without_fixed_root` in `accounts-db/src/accounts.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make `load_without_fixed_root` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `load_without_fixed_root` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts.rs` -> `load_without_fixed_root()` (around line 192)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `load_without_fixed_root` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `load_without_fixed_root` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `load_without_fixed_root` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
