# Q1007: service_loop can be driven into unbounded work (prioritization_fee_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `service_loop` in `runtime/src/prioritization_fee_cache.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make `service_loop` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `service_loop` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/prioritization_fee_cache.rs` -> `service_loop()` (around line 371)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `service_loop` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `service_loop` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `service_loop` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
