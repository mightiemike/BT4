# Q0655: increase_rooted_stake is not deterministic across nodes (commitment.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `increase_rooted_stake` in `runtime/src/commitment.rs` with an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation, and make the account state used to freeze the bank disagree with the account state written during the slot, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `increase_rooted_stake` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/commitment.rs` -> `increase_rooted_stake()` (around line 29)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation
- Exploit idea: Find input to `increase_rooted_stake` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `increase_rooted_stake` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `increase_rooted_stake` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
