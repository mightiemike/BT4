# Q1295: Authz wrapping weakens registry authority checks via Chain Token Config Payloads / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgRemoveTokenConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account when the attacker does not already control admin or governance keys, and cause `MsgRemoveTokenConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach a registry mutation through a wrapper path the module does not intend to trust, breaking the invariant that wrappers must not relax the authority boundary for registry writes, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_remove_token_config.go::MsgRemoveTokenConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgRemoveTokenConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach a registry mutation through a wrapper path the module does not intend to trust.
- Invariant to test: wrappers must not relax the authority boundary for registry writes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
