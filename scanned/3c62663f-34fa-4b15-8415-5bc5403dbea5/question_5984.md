# Q5984: unpack-u16 via supply-collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
