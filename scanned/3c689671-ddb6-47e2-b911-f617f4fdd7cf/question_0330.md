# Q0330: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `scale-debt-for-liquidation` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
