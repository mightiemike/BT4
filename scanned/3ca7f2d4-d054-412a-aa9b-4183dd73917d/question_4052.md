# Q4052: calc-utilization via redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` of shares burned reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `amount` of shares burned varied, and assert that the value `calc-utilization` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
