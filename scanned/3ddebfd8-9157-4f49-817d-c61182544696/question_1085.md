# Q1085: Gas deduction rollback boundary leaves execution without correct charge via Gasless Msgexecutepayload Msgmigrateuea Chosen / Payload Can Emit Receipt in MsgMigrateUEA.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData` when the payload can emit receipt logs that create outbounds or rescues, and cause `MsgMigrateUEA.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails, breaking the invariant that either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_migrate_uea.go::MsgMigrateUEA.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData`
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgMigrateUEA.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails.
- Invariant to test: either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
