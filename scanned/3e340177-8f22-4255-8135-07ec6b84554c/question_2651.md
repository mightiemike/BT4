# Q2651: Gas deduction rollback boundary leaves execution without correct charge via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Same Signed Intent May in msgServer.VoteInbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the same signed intent may be submitted more than once, and cause `msgServer.VoteInbound` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails, breaking the invariant that either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteInbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteInbound` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails.
- Invariant to test: either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
