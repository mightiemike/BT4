# Q5837: ubalance via transfer: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, drive `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) — which reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `transfer` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
