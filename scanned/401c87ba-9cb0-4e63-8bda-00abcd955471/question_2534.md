# Q2534: Migration record selection binds the wrong chain or old key via Two Logically Distinct Migrations / Pending-State Cleanup Is Necessary in Keeper.VoteOnFundMigrationBallot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields when pending-state cleanup is necessary to keep funds recoverable, and cause `Keeper.VoteOnFundMigrationBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended, breaking the invariant that each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/voting.go::Keeper.VoteOnFundMigrationBallot
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteOnFundMigrationBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended.
- Invariant to test: each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
