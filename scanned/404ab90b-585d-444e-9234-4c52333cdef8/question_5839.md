# Q5839: accrue-user-debts via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `accrue-user-debts` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
