# Q0644: Invalid inbound still creates a visible UTX but misroutes recovery via Inbound Whose Payload, Revert / Failed Inbound Should Still in MsgVoteInbound.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with an inbound whose payload, revert instructions, or recipient fields sit on edge-case boundaries when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `MsgVoteInbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state, breaking the invariant that failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_inbound.go::MsgVoteInbound.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: an inbound whose payload, revert instructions, or recipient fields sit on edge-case boundaries
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteInbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state.
- Invariant to test: failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
