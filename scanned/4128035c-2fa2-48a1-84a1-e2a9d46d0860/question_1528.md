# Q1528: Nil-vs-empty payload behavior changes funds-and-payload handling via Payload Fields Large Enough / Resulting Payload Can Move in DecodeRawPayload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization when the resulting payload can move value or spawn an outbound, and cause `DecodeRawPayload` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it flip a path between pure-funds and payload-carrying semantics using boundary-case payload encoding, breaking the invariant that nil and empty payload cases must not change execution mode in attacker-usable ways, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/decode_payload.go::DecodeRawPayload
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeRawPayload` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can flip a path between pure-funds and payload-carrying semantics using boundary-case payload encoding.
- Invariant to test: nil and empty payload cases must not change execution mode in attacker-usable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
