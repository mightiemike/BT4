# Q5128: total-assets via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
