# Q1632: Derived-key collision merges independent user flows via Fields Feed Directly Into / Different Observers May Supply in Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys when different observers may supply formatting variants of the same logical event, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it make two distinct logical records hash to one derived key because canonicalization is too weak, breaking the invariant that derived ids must uniquely represent one logical security object only, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can make two distinct logical records hash to one derived key because canonicalization is too weak.
- Invariant to test: derived ids must uniquely represent one logical security object only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
