# Q0650: total-assets-preview via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `total-assets-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
