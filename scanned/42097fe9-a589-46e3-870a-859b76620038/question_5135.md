# Q5135: resolve-or-create via liquidate: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `collateral-receiver`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
