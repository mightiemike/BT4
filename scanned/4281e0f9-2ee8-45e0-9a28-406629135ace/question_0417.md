# Q0417: Quorum recompute revives or flips a terminal ballot incorrectly via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Variant Handling Is Only in Ballot.IsExpired

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when variant handling is the only guard against semantic collisions, and cause `Ballot.IsExpired` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result, breaking the invariant that terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.IsExpired
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.IsExpired` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result.
- Invariant to test: terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
