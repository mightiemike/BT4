# Q1428: Payload-carrying inbound spawns the wrong outbound context via Inbound Whose Payload, Revert / Failed Inbound Should Still in Inbound.NormalizeForTxType

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with an inbound whose payload, revert instructions, or recipient fields sit on edge-case boundaries when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so that it make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction, breaking the invariant that outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.NormalizeForTxType
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: an inbound whose payload, revert instructions, or recipient fields sit on edge-case boundaries
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so it can make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction.
- Invariant to test: outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
