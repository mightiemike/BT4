# Q1575: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against validator status

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator, causing `validator status` to diverge so the invariant `validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators` fails and the attacker can transfer into a validator state that later cannot be exited without loss, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: transfer into a validator state that later cannot be exited without loss by testing the owner binding angle against `validator status` during `commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
