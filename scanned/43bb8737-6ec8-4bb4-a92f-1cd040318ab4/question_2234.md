# Q2234: Failed outbound remint credits the wrong recipient or asset via Outbound Whose Revert Instructions, / Destination Observation Drives Refund in Keeper.applyGasRefund

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action when the destination observation drives refund or revert logic, and cause `Keeper.applyGasRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it drive the revert path so re-minted value goes to the wrong address or PRC20, breaking the invariant that a failed outbound must restore exactly the original rightful value to exactly the intended recovery recipient, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/outbound.go::Keeper.applyGasRefund
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.applyGasRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can drive the revert path so re-minted value goes to the wrong address or PRC20.
- Invariant to test: a failed outbound must restore exactly the original rightful value to exactly the intended recovery recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
