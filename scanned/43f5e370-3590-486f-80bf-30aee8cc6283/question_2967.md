# Q2967: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-remove: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-debt-asset` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
