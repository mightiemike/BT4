# Q86: LockTier owner binding against delegation shares

## Question
Can unprivileged owner account enter through `msgServer.LockTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then submit MsgLockTier, force immediate exit, then claim rewards and attempt early exit cleanup, causing `delegation shares` to diverge so the invariant `position indexes and validator counts match the single active delegation created for the position` fails and the attacker can create a position whose indexes disagree with the actual delegation and let rewards or withdrawals route to the wrong owner, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.LockTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgLockTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: create a position whose indexes disagree with the actual delegation and let rewards or withdrawals route to the wrong owner by testing the owner binding angle against `delegation shares` during `submit MsgLockTier, force immediate exit, then claim rewards and attempt early exit cleanup`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: position indexes and validator counts match the single active delegation created for the position; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test around LockTier plus bank, staking, distribution, and tieredrewards stores; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
