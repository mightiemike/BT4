# Q2172: total-debt via liquidate-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
