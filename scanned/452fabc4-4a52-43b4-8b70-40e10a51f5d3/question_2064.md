# Q2064: mask-to-list-internal via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-internal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
