# Q2124: convert-to-shares-preview via transfer: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `transfer` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `convert-to-shares-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
