# Q1536: total-assets-preview via liquidate-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
