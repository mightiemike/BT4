# Q2418: Cross-chain tx-hash canonicalization merges unrelated events via Values Become Identical Only / Different Observers May Supply in Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization when different observers may supply formatting variants of the same logical event, and cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events, breaking the invariant that tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events.
- Invariant to test: tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
