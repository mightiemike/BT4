# Q2275: is_writing is not deterministic across nodes (transaction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `is_writing` in `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the serialized account layout handed to the program disagree with the layout the deserializer assumes on return, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `is_writing` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` -> `is_writing()` (around line 500)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `is_writing` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `is_writing` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `is_writing` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
