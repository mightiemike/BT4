# Q0744: Solana payload endianness or length parsing changes execution values via Payload Fields Large Enough / Resulting Payload Can Move in DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization when the resulting payload can move value or spawn an outbound, and cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it encode fields so the decoder reads a different amount, gas limit, nonce, or deadline than intended, breaking the invariant that decoded payload fields must match the exact source-chain user intent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/gateway_pc_event_decode.go::DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can encode fields so the decoder reads a different amount, gas limit, nonce, or deadline than intended.
- Invariant to test: decoded payload fields must match the exact source-chain user intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
