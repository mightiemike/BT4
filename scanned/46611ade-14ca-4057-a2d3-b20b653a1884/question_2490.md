# Q2490: Enabled-flag interpretation strands a live user flow via Cross-Chain Actions Depend On / Same Asset May Appear in ChainConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with cross-chain actions that depend on enabled flags, decimals, or native-representation fields when the same asset may appear in multiple encodings or address formats, and cause `ChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config, breaking the invariant that enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/chain_config.go::ChainConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: cross-chain actions that depend on enabled flags, decimals, or native-representation fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `ChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config.
- Invariant to test: enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
