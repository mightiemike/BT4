# Q5219: call-liquidate via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
