# Q2205: accrue-user-collateral via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, drive `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) — which accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-collateral` touches, run `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
