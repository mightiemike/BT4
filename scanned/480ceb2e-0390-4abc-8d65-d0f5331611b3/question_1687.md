# Q1687: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, then read `is-liquidation-paused` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
