# Q2893: get-egroup via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) — which resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `get-egroup` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
