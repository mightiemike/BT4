# Q2533: Migration record selection binds the wrong chain or old key via Process Ids, Event Ids, / Honest Validators Later Act in Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with process ids, event ids, key ids, or chain ids consumed when TSS state transitions finalize when honest validators later act on whatever TSS state the chain stores, and cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended, breaking the invariant that each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/tss_key_process.go::Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: process ids, event ids, key ids, or chain ids consumed when TSS state transitions finalize
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended.
- Invariant to test: each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
