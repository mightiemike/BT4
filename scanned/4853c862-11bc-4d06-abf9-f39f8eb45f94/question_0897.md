# Q0897: Registry params update changes who controls the module via Direct Submission Of Admin- / Config Change Would Immediately in MsgAddChainConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message when the config change would immediately affect live user flows if accepted, and cause `MsgAddChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it rotate authority or params from an unprivileged path, breaking the invariant that control of registry authority must be governance-bound only, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_add_chain_config.go::MsgAddChainConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgAddChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can rotate authority or params from an unprivileged path.
- Invariant to test: control of registry authority must be governance-bound only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
