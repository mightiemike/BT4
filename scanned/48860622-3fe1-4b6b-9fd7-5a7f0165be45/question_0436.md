# Q0436: resolve via collateral-remove: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it selects the efficiency group for a position mask, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
