# Q1403: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Observation Outcome Changes Value-Moving in Ballot.IsFinalized

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when the observation outcome changes a value-moving or liveness-critical path, and cause `Ballot.IsFinalized` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.IsFinalized
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.IsFinalized` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
