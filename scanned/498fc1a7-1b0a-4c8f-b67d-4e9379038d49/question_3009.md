# Q3009: log_router_publish is not deterministic across nodes (route_monitor.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `log_router_publish` in `xdp/src/route_monitor.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and make the transactions recorded into PoH for an entry disagree with the transactions committed to the bank for that entry, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `log_router_publish` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/route_monitor.rs` -> `log_router_publish()` (around line 248)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Find input to `log_router_publish` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `log_router_publish` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `log_router_publish` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
