# Q2986: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Variant Handling Is Only in MsgAddUniversalValidator.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when variant handling is the only guard against semantic collisions, and cause `MsgAddUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_add_universal_validator.go::MsgAddUniversalValidator.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgAddUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
