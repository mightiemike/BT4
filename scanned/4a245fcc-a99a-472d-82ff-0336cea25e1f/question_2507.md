# Q2507: get_max_retries is not deterministic across nodes (send_transaction_service.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `get_max_retries` in `send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and make the bank snapshot a subscription captured disagree with the bank that later serves the notification, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_max_retries` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs` -> `get_max_retries()` (around line 103)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_max_retries` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_max_retries` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_max_retries` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
