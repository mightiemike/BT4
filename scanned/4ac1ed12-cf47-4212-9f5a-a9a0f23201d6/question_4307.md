# Q4307: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-multi: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
