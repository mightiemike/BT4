# Q1754: Self-update message can rewrite another validator identity via Address Key Material Validate / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities when the attacker does not already control a privileged UV or admin role, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it bind signer and target-validator fields loosely enough that one account edits another UV record, breaking the invariant that only the UV itself should be able to mutate its own identity fields, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through misrouted cross-chain actions?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can bind signer and target-validator fields loosely enough that one account edits another UV record.
- Invariant to test: only the UV itself should be able to mutate its own identity fields
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through misrouted cross-chain actions
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
