# Q0474: resolve-interpolation-points via repay: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `repay` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `resolve-interpolation-points` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
