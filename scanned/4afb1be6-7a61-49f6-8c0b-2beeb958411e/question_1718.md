# Q1718: oracle-last-update via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `oracle-last-update` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
