# Q3314: receive-tokens via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `receive-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
