# Q5589: calc-multiplier-delta via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) — which compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-multiplier-delta` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
