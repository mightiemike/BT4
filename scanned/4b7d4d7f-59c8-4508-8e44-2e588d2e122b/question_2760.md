# Q2760: SendTransfer source sink direction against NFT owner

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.SendTransfer` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, focusing on packet token order, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then send an IBC voucher back toward origin and then process acknowledgement error, causing `NFT owner` to diverge so the invariant `next sequence and packet data cannot be reused to refund twice` fails and the attacker can include duplicate token ids and later receive duplicate refunds or remote mints, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/relay.go::Keeper.SendTransfer
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransfer for nft-transfer
- Attacker controls: SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, Sender, Receiver, timeout height, timeout timestamp
- Exploit idea: include duplicate token ids and later receive duplicate refunds or remote mints by testing the source sink direction angle against `NFT owner` during `send an IBC voucher back toward origin and then process acknowledgement error`, with specific focus on packet token order.
- Invariant to test: next sequence and packet data cannot be reused to refund twice; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: IBC app test over SendTransfer, createOutgoingPacket, OnAcknowledgementPacket, and OnTimeoutPacket; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
