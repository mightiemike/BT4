# Q307: TierUndelegate owner binding against ExitUnlockAt

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TierUndelegate` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then undelegate after the validator becomes unbonded or removed and then attempt withdrawal, causing `ExitUnlockAt` to diverge so the invariant `withdrawable unbonded funds remain in the position delegator until the owner-only withdrawal` fails and the attacker can bypass the exit lock at exact timestamp boundaries and withdraw stake early, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TierUndelegate
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTierUndelegate transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, validator state
- Exploit idea: bypass the exit lock at exact timestamp boundaries and withdraw stake early by testing the owner binding angle against `ExitUnlockAt` during `undelegate after the validator becomes unbonded or removed and then attempt withdrawal`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: withdrawable unbonded funds remain in the position delegator until the owner-only withdrawal; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state-machine test over TriggerExitFromTier, TierUndelegate, staking unbonding, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
