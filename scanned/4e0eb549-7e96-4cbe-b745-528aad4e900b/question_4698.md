# Q4698: relevant via collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `relevant` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
