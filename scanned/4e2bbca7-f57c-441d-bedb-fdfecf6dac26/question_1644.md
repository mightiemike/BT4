# Q1644: debt-preview via transfer: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `transfer` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `debt-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
