# Q4935: total-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-debt` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
