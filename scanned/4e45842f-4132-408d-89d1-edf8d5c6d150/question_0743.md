# Q0743: Solana payload endianness or length parsing changes execution values via Hex Blobs Ambiguous Emptiness, / Honest Uvs Agree On in DecodeRescueFundsOnSourceChainFromLog

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics when honest UVs agree on the source event but the chain derives the payload itself, and cause `DecodeRescueFundsOnSourceChainFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it encode fields so the decoder reads a different amount, gas limit, nonce, or deadline than intended, breaking the invariant that decoded payload fields must match the exact source-chain user intent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/gateway_pc_event_decode.go::DecodeRescueFundsOnSourceChainFromLog
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeRescueFundsOnSourceChainFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can encode fields so the decoder reads a different amount, gas limit, nonce, or deadline than intended.
- Invariant to test: decoded payload fields must match the exact source-chain user intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
