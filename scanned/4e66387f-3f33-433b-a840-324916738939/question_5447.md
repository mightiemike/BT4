# Q5447: vault-accrue via deposit: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `min-out`, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `deposit` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-out`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
