# Q2340: Concurrent-process assumptions break under attacker-timed flows via User-Created Outbound Flow Eventually / Attacker Can Create More in TssKey.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state when the attacker can create more than one related flow over time, and cause `TssKey.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach overlapping TSS state transitions that the module assumes cannot coexist, breaking the invariant that TSS lifecycle must serialize mutually exclusive processes safely, and resulting in Wrong signing state or inability to finalize cross-chain funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/tss_key.go::TssKey.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state
- Exploit idea: Cause `TssKey.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach overlapping TSS state transitions that the module assumes cannot coexist.
- Invariant to test: TSS lifecycle must serialize mutually exclusive processes safely
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong signing state or inability to finalize cross-chain funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
