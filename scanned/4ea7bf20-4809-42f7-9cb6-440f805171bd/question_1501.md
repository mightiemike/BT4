# Q1501: Lookup failure falls back unsafely in a value-moving path via Chain Ids, Token Addresses, / Same Asset May Appear in Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows when the same asset may appear in multiple encodings or address formats, and cause `Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so that it force a missing-registry edge case to continue with a default or stale interpretation, breaking the invariant that missing registry state must fail closed before any value movement occurs, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-asset transfer?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/keeper.go::Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so it can force a missing-registry edge case to continue with a default or stale interpretation.
- Invariant to test: missing registry state must fail closed before any value movement occurs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-asset transfer
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
