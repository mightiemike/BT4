# Q3404: Domain separation gap cross-links two record families via Two Logically Distinct Events / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.CreateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with two logically distinct events represented with formatting variants when the attacker can create multiple candidate events or observations, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it cause ids from one domain to be usable in another because separation or labeling is incomplete, breaking the invariant that inbound, outbound, rescue, revert, and ballot records must be cryptographically disjoint, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or wrong finalization leading to permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct events represented with formatting variants
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can cause ids from one domain to be usable in another because separation or labeling is incomplete.
- Invariant to test: inbound, outbound, rescue, revert, and ballot records must be cryptographically disjoint
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or wrong finalization leading to permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
