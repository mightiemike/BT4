# Q1269: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against PositionsByTier

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then undelegate, wait for unbonding completion, then withdraw at boundary time, causing `PositionsByTier` to diverge so the invariant `position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal` fails and the attacker can withdraw another user's unlocked delegator balance by supplying their PositionId, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: withdraw another user's unlocked delegator balance by supplying their PositionId by testing the owner binding angle against `PositionsByTier` during `undelegate, wait for unbonding completion, then withdraw at boundary time`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
