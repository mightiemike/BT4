# Q0356: calc-treasury-lp-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `calc-treasury-lp-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
