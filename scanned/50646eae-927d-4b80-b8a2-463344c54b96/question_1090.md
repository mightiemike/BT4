# Q1090: sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits grows memory without an enforced bound (compute_budget_instruction_details.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` in `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` with a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count, and grow the buffer `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` -> `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits()` (around line 101)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply create accounts or writes that force disproportionate storage, index, scan, hashing, or background-cleanup work and exhaust node memory or disk below true transaction cost.
