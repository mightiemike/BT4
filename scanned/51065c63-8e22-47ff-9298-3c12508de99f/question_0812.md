# Q0812: sync-order dependent state via `run` (da_block_handler.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes L1 data that a syncing full node must process before it has the matching proof, controlling the timing of proof versus commitment arrival, drive `run` in `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` so that the state a node reaches syncing from genesis and the state a node reaches syncing from a snapshot stop being the same, breaking the invariant that final state is independent of sync path?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/fullnode/src/da_block_handler.rs` -> `run`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes L1 data that a syncing full node must process before it has the matching proof
- Attacker controls: the timing of proof versus commitment arrival
- Exploit idea: sync-order dependent state - reach `run` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the state a node reaches syncing from genesis and the state a node reaches syncing from a snapshot stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `ProcessingResult`, `ProofSource`, `L1BlockHandler`, `process_queued_l1_blocks`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: final state is independent of sync path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: sync both ways over the same range and diff roots
