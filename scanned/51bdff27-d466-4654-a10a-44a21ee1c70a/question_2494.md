# Q2494: TransferNFT owner binding against escrow address ownership

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `msgServer.TransferNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, focusing on IBC-prefixed denom separation, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then transfer from or to an escrow/module address and test later refunds, causing `escrow address ownership` to diverge so the invariant `collection state remains single-owner after rapid transfer/send ordering` fails and the attacker can move an escrowed NFT out of IBC custody and cause later unescrow loss, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TransferNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransferNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: move an escrowed NFT out of IBC custody and cause later unescrow loss by testing the owner binding angle against `escrow address ownership` during `transfer from or to an escrow/module address and test later refunds`, with specific focus on IBC-prefixed denom separation.
- Invariant to test: collection state remains single-owner after rapid transfer/send ordering; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper/app test asserting owner indexes before and after TransferNFT and IBC send; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
