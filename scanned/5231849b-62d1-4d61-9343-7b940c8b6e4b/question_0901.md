# Q0901: increment via repay: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) — which advances the user-id nonce — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), then read `increment` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
