# Q2892: find via collateral-remove: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `find` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
