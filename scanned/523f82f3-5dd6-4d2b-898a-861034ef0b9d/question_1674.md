# Q1674: calc-liq-factor via liquidate-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
