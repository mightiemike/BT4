# Q4280: user-safe-mask via liquidate-multi: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `user-safe-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
