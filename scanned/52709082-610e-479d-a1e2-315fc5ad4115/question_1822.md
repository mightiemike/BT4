# Q1822: Ballot identity collision finalizes the wrong inbound variant via Two Logically Distinct Inbounds / Honest Uvs Later Finalize in Inbound.NormalizeForTxType

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting when honest UVs later finalize whatever canonical observation wins, and cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so that it make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds, breaking the invariant that one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.NormalizeForTxType
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so it can make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds.
- Invariant to test: one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
