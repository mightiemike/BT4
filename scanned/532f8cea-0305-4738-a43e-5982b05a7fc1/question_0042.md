# Q0042: UTX identity collision merges distinct deposits via Source-Chain Fields Such As / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.ExecuteInboundFunds

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload` when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundFunds` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another, breaking the invariant that each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/execute_inbound_funds.go::Keeper.ExecuteInboundFunds
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundFunds` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make two different user deposits share one UTX identity or block one another.
- Invariant to test: each logical inbound event must map to exactly one unique UTX and exactly one execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
