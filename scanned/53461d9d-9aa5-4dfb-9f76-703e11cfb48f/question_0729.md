# Q0729: Observed chain id confusion writes meta under the wrong chain via Gasless Msgvotechainmeta Submission If / First Write Stale Update in Keeper.SetChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `Keeper.SetChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it cause a user-relevant chain to consume another chain's gas-price or height data, breaking the invariant that chain meta must be namespaced so one chain's oracle data cannot affect another, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.SetChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.SetChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can cause a user-relevant chain to consume another chain's gas-price or height data.
- Invariant to test: chain meta must be namespaced so one chain's oracle data cannot affect another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
