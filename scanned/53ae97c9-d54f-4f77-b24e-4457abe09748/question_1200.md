# Q1200: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against Positions

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then send extra coins to the position delegator before withdrawal and verify sweep behavior, causing `Positions` to diverge so the invariant `delegator dust cannot include unrelated user or module funds unless intentionally sent and owner-bound` fails and the attacker can delete a position while delegation or unbonding still exists and later recover funds twice, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: delete a position while delegation or unbonding still exists and later recover funds twice by testing the owner binding angle against `Positions` during `send extra coins to the position delegator before withdrawal and verify sweep behavior`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: delegator dust cannot include unrelated user or module funds unless intentionally sent and owner-bound; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
