# Q0024: get-liquidation-position via borrow: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `borrow` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `get-liquidation-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
