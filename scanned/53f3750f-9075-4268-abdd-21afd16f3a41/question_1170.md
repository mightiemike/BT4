# Q1170: Oversized payload-ish fields pass basic checks and later overload execution via Caip-2 Identifiers, Addresses, Amounts, / Same Field Is Later in Params.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with CAIP-2 identifiers, addresses, amounts, enums, signatures, or status fields accepted by the type when the same field is later canonicalized or decoded more aggressively, and cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it submit large data that validation accepts even though live processing must fully decode or iterate it, breaking the invariant that validation must keep public inputs from becoming chain-execution DoS vectors, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/params.go::Params.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: CAIP-2 identifiers, addresses, amounts, enums, signatures, or status fields accepted by the type
- Exploit idea: Cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can submit large data that validation accepts even though live processing must fully decode or iterate it.
- Invariant to test: validation must keep public inputs from becoming chain-execution DoS vectors
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
