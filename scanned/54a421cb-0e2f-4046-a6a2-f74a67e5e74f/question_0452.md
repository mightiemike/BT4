# Q0452: debt-remove-scaled via transfer: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `transfer` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
