# Q146: LockTier owner binding against NextPositionId

## Question
Can unprivileged owner account enter through `msgServer.LockTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then submit MsgLockTier, force immediate exit, then claim rewards and attempt early exit cleanup, causing `NextPositionId` to diverge so the invariant `created position owner, delegator address, tier id, validator, and distribution withdraw address remain bound to the signer` fails and the attacker can capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.LockTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgLockTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator by testing the owner binding angle against `NextPositionId` during `submit MsgLockTier, force immediate exit, then claim rewards and attempt early exit cleanup`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: created position owner, delegator address, tier id, validator, and distribution withdraw address remain bound to the signer; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test around LockTier plus bank, staking, distribution, and tieredrewards stores; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
