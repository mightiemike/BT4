# Q0613: system-repay via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) — which splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid` — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `amount`, then read `system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
