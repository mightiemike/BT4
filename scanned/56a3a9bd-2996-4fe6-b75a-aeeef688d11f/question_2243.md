# Q2243: next-index via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
