# Q2352: interest-rate via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
