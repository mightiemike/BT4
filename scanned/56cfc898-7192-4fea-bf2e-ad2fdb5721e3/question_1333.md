# Q1333: Derived payload differs from the UV-submitted semantic fields via Rawpayload Bytes Emitted From / Payload Size Structure Sits in DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with `raw_payload` bytes emitted from a user-controlled source-chain event when payload size or structure sits at a parser boundary, and cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it rely on the chain ignoring one representation and executing another without equivalent validation, breaking the invariant that the derived payload must not diverge from the security-relevant semantics that honest voting implies, and resulting in Unauthorized execution or direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/decode_payload.go::DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: `raw_payload` bytes emitted from a user-controlled source-chain event
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadSolana` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can rely on the chain ignoring one representation and executing another without equivalent validation.
- Invariant to test: the derived payload must not diverge from the security-relevant semantics that honest voting implies
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized execution or direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
