# Q5517: collateral-add via transfer: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling `amount`, drive `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) — which evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `transfer` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `collateral-add` touches, run `transfer` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
