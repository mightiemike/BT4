# Q3751: are_snapshot_archive_kinds_the_same_kind can serve state that disagrees with the cache (compare.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `are_snapshot_archive_kinds_the_same_kind` in `runtime/src/snapshot_package/compare.rs` with a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once, and make the sysvar value cached for execution disagree with the sysvar account content committed to state, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_package/compare.rs` -> `are_snapshot_archive_kinds_the_same_kind()` (around line 70)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once
- Exploit idea: Make `are_snapshot_archive_kinds_the_same_kind` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
