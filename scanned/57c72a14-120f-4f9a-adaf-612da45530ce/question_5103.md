# Q5103: convert-to-shares-preview via accrue: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the utilization the rate is interpolated at, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `accrue` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-shares-preview` touches, run `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
