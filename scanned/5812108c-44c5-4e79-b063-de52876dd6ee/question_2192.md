# Q2192: find-superset via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `find-superset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
