# Q3025: crypto/index — query normalization mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit mixed encoding of '+' vs '%20' in the pre-hash string to this module in `crypto/index.ts` such that normalizeQuery/stringify* orders or encodes params so an unsigned variant validates, breaking the invariant that query serialization is injective and matches signer, and leading to: hmac bypass on app-proxy/callback?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/apps/shopify-api/runtime/crypto/index.ts` -> (module scope)
- Entrypoint: HMAC-signed request (webhook/app-proxy/OAuth callback) to the app
- Attacker controls: mixed encoding of '+' vs '%20' in the pre-hash string
- Exploit idea: normalizeQuery/stringify* orders or encodes params so an unsigned variant validates
- Invariant to test: query serialization is injective and matches signer
- Expected Immunefi impact: HMAC bypass on app-proxy/callback (In scope: signature-verification bypass (forged Shopify request accepted). Note: shopify-app-js is covered under Shopify's HackerOne program, not Immunefi; SECURITY.md "Websites and Apps" exclusions apply.)
- Fast validation: fuzz duplicated/reordered keys and assert single valid encoding
