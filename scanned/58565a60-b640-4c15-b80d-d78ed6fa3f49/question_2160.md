# Q2160: send-tokens via borrow: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `borrow` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `send-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
