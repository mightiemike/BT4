# Q1163: Address-formatting differences split one UV into two identities via Address Key Material Validate / Eligibility Decisions Must Stay in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities when eligibility decisions must stay consistent during one observation lifecycle, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it cause one validator to appear under multiple equivalent identities across modules, breaking the invariant that one UV must map to one canonical identity in all modules, and resulting in Wrong finalization or frozen funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can cause one validator to appear under multiple equivalent identities across modules.
- Invariant to test: one UV must map to one canonical identity in all modules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization or frozen funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
