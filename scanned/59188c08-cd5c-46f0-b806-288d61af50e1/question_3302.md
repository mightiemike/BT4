# Q3302: get_bucket confuses account types or owners (bucket_map.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `get_bucket` in `bucket_map/src/bucket_map.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and have `get_bucket` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_bucket` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket_map.rs` -> `get_bucket()` (around line 184)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_bucket` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_bucket` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_bucket` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
