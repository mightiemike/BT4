# Q0578: unpack-u16 via accrue: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `accrue` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
