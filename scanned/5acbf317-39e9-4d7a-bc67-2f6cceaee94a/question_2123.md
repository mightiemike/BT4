# Q2123: principal-ratio-reduction via redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
