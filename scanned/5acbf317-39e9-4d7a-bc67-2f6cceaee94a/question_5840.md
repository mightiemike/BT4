# Q5840: find-debt-scaled via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `find-debt-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
