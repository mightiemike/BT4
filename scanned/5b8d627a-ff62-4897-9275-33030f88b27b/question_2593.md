# Q2593: receive-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, drive `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) — which pulls an asset from a named account — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, then read `receive-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
