# Q5062: collateral-remove via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
