# Q2458: find-collateral-amount via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
