# Q0196: obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots breaks lamport conservation (obsolete_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots` in `accounts-db/src/obsolete_accounts.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and make the lamports `obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/obsolete_accounts.rs` -> `obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots()` (around line 52)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Drive `obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `obsolete_accounts_for_snapshots`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
