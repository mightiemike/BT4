# Q0207: store can serve state that disagrees with the cache (read_only_accounts_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `store` in `accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make the account state visible on this fork's ancestors disagree with the state a later load on the same fork returns, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs` -> `store()` (around line 189)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Make `store` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
