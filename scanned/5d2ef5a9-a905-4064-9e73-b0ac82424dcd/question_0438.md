# Q438: TierUndelegate owner binding against reward pool balance

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TierUndelegate` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then repeat ClearPosition and TierUndelegate around the exit lock boundary, causing `reward pool balance` to diverge so the invariant `only the position owner can begin unbonding for that position` fails and the attacker can start unbonding another user's delegated position and later withdraw its unlocked funds, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TierUndelegate
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTierUndelegate transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, validator state
- Exploit idea: start unbonding another user's delegated position and later withdraw its unlocked funds by testing the owner binding angle against `reward pool balance` during `repeat ClearPosition and TierUndelegate around the exit lock boundary`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: only the position owner can begin unbonding for that position; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state-machine test over TriggerExitFromTier, TierUndelegate, staking unbonding, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
