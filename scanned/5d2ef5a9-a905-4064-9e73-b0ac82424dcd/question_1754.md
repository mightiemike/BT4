# Q1754: transferDelegationFromPosition owner binding against position shares

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then exit with amount equal to full position amount when shares have fractional dust, causing `position shares` to diverge so the invariant `remaining position amount is reconciled from shares after transfer` fails and the attacker can delete position while nonzero shares or rewards remain claimable, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgExitTierWithDelegation internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, redelegation state
- Exploit idea: delete position while nonzero shares or rewards remain claimable by testing the owner binding angle against `position shares` during `exit with amount equal to full position amount when shares have fractional dust`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: remaining position amount is reconciled from shares after transfer; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz test over amount/share boundaries around ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
