# Q2885: is-healthy via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `min-underlying`, drive `is-healthy` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656) — which returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)` — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656` -> `is-healthy`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy` returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-underlying`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
