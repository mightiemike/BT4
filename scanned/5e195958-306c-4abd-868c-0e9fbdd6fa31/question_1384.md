# Q1384: load_addresses_for_view is not deterministic across nodes (receive_and_buffer.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `load_addresses_for_view` in `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/receive_and_buffer.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make the blockstore's view of a slot's contents disagree with the bank state derived from that slot, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `load_addresses_for_view` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/receive_and_buffer.rs` -> `load_addresses_for_view()` (around line 459)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Find input to `load_addresses_for_view` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `load_addresses_for_view` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `load_addresses_for_view` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
