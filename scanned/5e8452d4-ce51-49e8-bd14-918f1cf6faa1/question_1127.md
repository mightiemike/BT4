# Q1127: ClaimTierRewards owner binding against LastBonusAccrual

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClaimTierRewards` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim many positions around validator bond, unbond, and slash events, causing `LastBonusAccrual` to diverge so the invariant `base rewards are routed only to the position owner` fails and the attacker can use stale LastKnownBonded to accrue rewards through an unbonded interval, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClaimTierRewards
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClaimTierRewards transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, claim batching
- Exploit idea: use stale LastKnownBonded to accrue rewards through an unbonded interval by testing the owner binding angle against `LastBonusAccrual` during `claim many positions around validator bond, unbond, and slash events`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: base rewards are routed only to the position owner; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz/state-machine test over ClaimTierRewards with validator events and repeated batches; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
