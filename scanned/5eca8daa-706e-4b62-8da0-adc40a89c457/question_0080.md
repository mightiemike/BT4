# Q0080: next-index via supply-collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
