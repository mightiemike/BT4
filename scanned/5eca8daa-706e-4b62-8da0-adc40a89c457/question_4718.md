# Q4718: subset via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `min-underlying`, can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `subset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
