# Q5456: get-available-assets via redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` of shares burned reach `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `amount` of shares burned varied, and assert that the value `get-available-assets` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
