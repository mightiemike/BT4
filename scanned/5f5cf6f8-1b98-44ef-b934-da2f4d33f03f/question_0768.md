# Q0768: remove-user-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver` for the underlying leg across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
