# Q1404: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor-bound` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
