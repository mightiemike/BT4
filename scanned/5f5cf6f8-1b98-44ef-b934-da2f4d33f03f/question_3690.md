# Q3690: remove-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
