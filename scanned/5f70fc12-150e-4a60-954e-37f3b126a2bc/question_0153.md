# Q0153: Cross-namespace decoding ambiguity changes the executed payload via Rawpayload Bytes Emitted From / Payload Is Only Source in DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with `raw_payload` bytes emitted from a user-controlled source-chain event when the payload is the only source of execution semantics for the inbound, and cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it make the same raw payload decode into a different semantic call than honest observers expect, breaking the invariant that raw payload decoding must have one deterministic interpretation for one source-chain namespace, and resulting in Unauthorized execution, direct fund loss, or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/gateway_pc_event_decode.go::DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: `raw_payload` bytes emitted from a user-controlled source-chain event
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can make the same raw payload decode into a different semantic call than honest observers expect.
- Invariant to test: raw payload decoding must have one deterministic interpretation for one source-chain namespace
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized execution, direct fund loss, or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
