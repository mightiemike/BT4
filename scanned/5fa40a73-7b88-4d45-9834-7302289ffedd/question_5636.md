# Q5636: header chain continuity via `time` (header.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who constructs a Bitcoin block whose coinbase witness commitment is structurally unusual, controlling the proof pair it induces the node to build, drive `time` in `crates/bitcoin-da/src/spec/header.rs` so that the previous block hash a header claims and the hash of the preceding processed block stop being equal, breaking the invariant that processed headers form one chain?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/bitcoin-da/src/spec/header.rs` -> `time`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party constructs a Bitcoin block whose coinbase witness commitment is structurally unusual
- Attacker controls: the proof pair it induces the node to build
- Exploit idea: header chain continuity - reach `time` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the previous block hash a header claims and the hash of the preceding processed block stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `HeaderWrapper`, `BitcoinHeaderWrapper`, `prev_hash`, `verify_hash`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: processed headers form one chain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: feed a header with a wrong parent and assert rejection
