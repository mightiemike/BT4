# Q1402: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Observation Variants Differ Only / Attacker Can Generate Many in Ballot.IsExpired

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `Ballot.IsExpired` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/ballot.go::Ballot.IsExpired
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Ballot.IsExpired` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
