# Q2356: subscriber_total lets attacker data change the committed hash (rpc_subscription_tracker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `subscriber_total` in `rpc/src/rpc_subscription_tracker.rs` with a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide, and make the transaction status recorded at commit disagree with the status returned by the status query, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/rpc_subscription_tracker.rs` -> `subscriber_total()` (around line 283)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `subscriber_total` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
