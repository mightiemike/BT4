# Q679: AddToTierPosition owner binding against reward checkpoints

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.AddToTierPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then add dust-sized or minimum-sized funds to a large position and exit partially, causing `reward checkpoints` to diverge so the invariant `pending rewards are claimed and checkpoints advanced before added stake accrues bonus` fails and the attacker can make added stake accrue rewards for time before it was locked, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.AddToTierPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgAddToTierPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, validator exchange rate
- Exploit idea: make added stake accrue rewards for time before it was locked by testing the owner binding angle against `reward checkpoints` during `add dust-sized or minimum-sized funds to a large position and exit partially`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: pending rewards are claimed and checkpoints advanced before added stake accrues bonus; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over AddToTierPosition, claimRewards, delegate, and position state conversion; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
