# Q1505: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against redelegation status

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator, causing `redelegation status` to diverge so the invariant `validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators` fails and the attacker can mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch by testing the owner binding angle against `redelegation status` during `commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
