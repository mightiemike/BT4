# Q0923: calc-cumulative-debt via deposit: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) multiplies scaled principal by an index. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `recipient`, including a contract principal, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `deposit` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
