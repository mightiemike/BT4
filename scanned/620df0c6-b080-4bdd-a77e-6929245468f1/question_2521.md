# Q2521: Gasless TSS vote admission can be replayed cheaply at scale via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Gasless Admission Can Make in msgServer.VoteFundMigration

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when gasless admission can make repetition cheap, and cause `msgServer.VoteFundMigration` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it use first-use or fee-bypass behavior to repeatedly hit TSS-critical vote paths from an unfunded account, breaking the invariant that TSS vote paths must not become an unprivileged free-spam finalization primitive, and resulting in Inability to finalize or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteFundMigration
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteFundMigration` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can use first-use or fee-bypass behavior to repeatedly hit TSS-critical vote paths from an unfunded account.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote paths must not become an unprivileged free-spam finalization primitive
- Expected Immunefi impact: Inability to finalize or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
