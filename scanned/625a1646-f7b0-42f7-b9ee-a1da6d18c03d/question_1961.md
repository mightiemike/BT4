# Q1961: inflation_rewards_commission_offset arithmetic overflows on reachable values (frame_v4.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `inflation_rewards_commission_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v4.rs` with a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide, and make the arithmetic in `inflation_rewards_commission_offset` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v4.rs` -> `inflation_rewards_commission_offset()` (around line 85)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `inflation_rewards_commission_offset` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `inflation_rewards_commission_offset` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
