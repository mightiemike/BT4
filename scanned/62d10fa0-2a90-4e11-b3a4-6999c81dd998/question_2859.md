# Q2859: UEA address resolution collides across attacker-chosen account fields via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it cause two distinct universal accounts to resolve to one execution address or one account to resolve inconsistently, breaking the invariant that universal account identity must map injectively to one UEA address, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_migrate_uea.go::MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can cause two distinct universal accounts to resolve to one execution address or one account to resolve inconsistently.
- Invariant to test: universal account identity must map injectively to one UEA address
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
