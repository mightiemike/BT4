# Q1487: Validation accepts a dangerous no-op-to-live config transition via Chain Token Config Payloads / Message Is Directly User-Submittable in MsgAddChainConfig.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account when the message is directly user-submittable over normal transaction channels, and cause `MsgAddChainConfig.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it supply a config mutation that looks harmless at basic validation but becomes live and dangerous later, breaking the invariant that authority-gated writes must fully validate dangerous config transitions before commit, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_add_chain_config.go::MsgAddChainConfig.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgAddChainConfig.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can supply a config mutation that looks harmless at basic validation but becomes live and dangerous later.
- Invariant to test: authority-gated writes must fully validate dangerous config transitions before commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
