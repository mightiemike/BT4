# Q5645: vault-system-borrow via repay: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) — which routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
