# Q3253: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via deposit: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `amount`, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `deposit` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `amount`, then read `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
