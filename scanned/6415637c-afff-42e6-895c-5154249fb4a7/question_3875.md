# Q3875: receive-underlying via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) pulls the underlying from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
