# Q3035: Direct payload execution bypasses contract-level replay assumptions via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Target Uea Already Holds in Keeper.CallUniversalCoreSetChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreSetChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it submit payload material in a way that the Cosmos layer treats as new while the contract should not, breaking the invariant that a payload must not be executable more than once for one authorization intent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss via duplicate execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/evm.go::Keeper.CallUniversalCoreSetChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreSetChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can submit payload material in a way that the Cosmos layer treats as new while the contract should not.
- Invariant to test: a payload must not be executable more than once for one authorization intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss via duplicate execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
