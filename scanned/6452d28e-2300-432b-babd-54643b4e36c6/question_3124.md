# Q3124: Migration fee or gas assumptions corrupt the migrated amount via User-Created Outbound Flow Eventually / Attacker Can Create More in Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state when the attacker can create more than one related flow over time, and cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it push a migration-related value path through wrong gas or refund semantics, breaking the invariant that migration logic must preserve the exact amount and ownership of moved funds, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/tss_key_process.go::Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can push a migration-related value path through wrong gas or refund semantics.
- Invariant to test: migration logic must preserve the exact amount and ownership of moved funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
