# Q1165: new_ref_with_limit grows memory without an enforced bound (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `new_ref_with_limit` in `svm-log-collector/src/lib.rs` with a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance, and grow the buffer `new_ref_with_limit` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `svm-log-collector/src/lib.rs` -> `new_ref_with_limit()` (around line 52)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `new_ref_with_limit` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply create accounts or writes that force disproportionate storage, index, scan, hashing, or background-cleanup work and exhaust node memory or disk below true transaction cost.
