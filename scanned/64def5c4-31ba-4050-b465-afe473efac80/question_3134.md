# Q3134: Self-update validation misses a field required for safe downstream use via Address Key Material Validate / Mutated Identity Would Affect in NetworkInfo.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities when the mutated identity would affect live cross-chain flows, and cause `NetworkInfo.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it set an apparently valid identity field to a value that later misroutes funds or signatures, breaking the invariant that every downstream-critical identity field must be validated before commit, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/network_info.go::NetworkInfo.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities
- Exploit idea: Cause `NetworkInfo.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can set an apparently valid identity field to a value that later misroutes funds or signatures.
- Invariant to test: every downstream-critical identity field must be validated before commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
