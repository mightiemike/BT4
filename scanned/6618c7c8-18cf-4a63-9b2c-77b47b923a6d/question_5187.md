# Q5187: fee vault accounting via `balance` (genesis.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who sends a transaction crafted to collide with the `SYSTEM_SIGNER` account's nonce space, controlling contract bytecode and calldata, drive `balance` in `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` so that the value deducted from the sender and the value credited to the base-fee/L1-fee/priority-fee vaults stop being equal, breaking the invariant that fees are conserved between payer and vaults?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` -> `balance`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party sends a transaction crafted to collide with the `SYSTEM_SIGNER` account's nonce space
- Attacker controls: contract bytecode and calldata
- Exploit idea: fee vault accounting - reach `balance` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the value deducted from the sender and the value credited to the base-fee/L1-fee/priority-fee vaults stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `AccountData`, `AccountDataHelper`, `EvmConfig`, `empty_code`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: fees are conserved between payer and vaults
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user or vault funds
- Fast validation: sum vault deltas against sender deltas over an adversarial block
