# Q3012: relevant via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `relevant` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
