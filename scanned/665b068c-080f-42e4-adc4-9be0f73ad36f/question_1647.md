# Q1647: transferDelegationFromPosition owner binding against transferred amount

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then repeat partial exits until just above min lock and then claim rewards, causing `transferred amount` to diverge so the invariant `full exit consumes all position shares and leaves no reward-bearing dust` fails and the attacker can avoid slashing by transferring during redelegation or validator status changes, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgExitTierWithDelegation internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, redelegation state
- Exploit idea: avoid slashing by transferring during redelegation or validator status changes by testing the owner binding angle against `transferred amount` during `repeat partial exits until just above min lock and then claim rewards`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: full exit consumes all position shares and leaves no reward-bearing dust; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz test over amount/share boundaries around ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
