# Q0906: load_addresses confuses account types or owners (address_lookup_table.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `load_addresses` in `runtime/src/bank/address_lookup_table.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and have `load_addresses` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`load_addresses` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/address_lookup_table.rs` -> `load_addresses()` (around line 25)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `load_addresses` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `load_addresses` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `load_addresses` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
