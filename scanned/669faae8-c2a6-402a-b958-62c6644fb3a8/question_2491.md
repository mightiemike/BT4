# Q2491: get_transaction_logs confuses account types or owners (rpc_subscriptions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `get_transaction_logs` in `rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and have `get_transaction_logs` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_transaction_logs` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs` -> `get_transaction_logs()` (around line 65)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_transaction_logs` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_transaction_logs` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_transaction_logs` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
