# Q0965: Cross-chain identity update breaks TSS or outbound recipient assumptions via Direct Msgupdateuniversalvalidator Related Uvalidator / Downstream Modules Trust Uv in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message when downstream modules trust the UV identity for voting or offchain routing, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it change a UV record in a way that downstream modules trust too broadly, breaking the invariant that identity updates must not silently rebind critical offchain or outbound-control semantics, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can change a UV record in a way that downstream modules trust too broadly.
- Invariant to test: identity updates must not silently rebind critical offchain or outbound-control semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
