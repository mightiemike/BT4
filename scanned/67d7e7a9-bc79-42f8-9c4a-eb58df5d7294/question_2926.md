# Q2926: Vote finalization math on TSS state accepts a wrong event via Two Logically Distinct Migrations / Honest Validators Later Act in Keeper.completePreviousActiveFinalizedEvent

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields when honest validators later act on whatever TSS state the chain stores, and cause `Keeper.completePreviousActiveFinalizedEvent` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it drive a minority or malformed event to the state machine as if it had quorum, breaking the invariant that TSS state transitions must require exactly the intended quorum semantics, and resulting in Wrong TSS finalization leading to direct loss or frozen funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/tss_events.go::Keeper.completePreviousActiveFinalizedEvent
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.completePreviousActiveFinalizedEvent` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can drive a minority or malformed event to the state machine as if it had quorum.
- Invariant to test: TSS state transitions must require exactly the intended quorum semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS finalization leading to direct loss or frozen funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
