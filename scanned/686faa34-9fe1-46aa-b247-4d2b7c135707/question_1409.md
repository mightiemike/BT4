# Q1409: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Observation Outcome Changes Value-Moving in LifecycleInfo.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when the observation outcome changes a value-moving or liveness-critical path, and cause `LifecycleInfo.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/lifecyle_info.go::LifecycleInfo.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `LifecycleInfo.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
