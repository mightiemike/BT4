# Q3868: adjust_delegation_for_rent breaks lamport conservation (distribution.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `adjust_delegation_for_rent` in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and make the lamports `adjust_delegation_for_rent` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` -> `adjust_delegation_for_rent()` (around line 55)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Drive `adjust_delegation_for_rent` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `adjust_delegation_for_rent`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
