# Q3165: population via borrow: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) — which counts set bits to order the bucket search — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `borrow` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `population` touches, run `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
