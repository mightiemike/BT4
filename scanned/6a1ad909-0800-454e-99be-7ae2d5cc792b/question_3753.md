# Q3753: are_snapshot_packages_the_same_kind lets attacker data change the committed hash (compare.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `are_snapshot_packages_the_same_kind` in `runtime/src/snapshot_package/compare.rs` with a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once, and make the reward partition assigned to a stake account disagree with the reward actually credited to it, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_package/compare.rs` -> `are_snapshot_packages_the_same_kind()` (around line 48)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `are_snapshot_packages_the_same_kind` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
