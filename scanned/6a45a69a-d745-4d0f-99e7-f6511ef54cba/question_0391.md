# Q391: TierUndelegate owner binding against unbonding delegation

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TierUndelegate` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then call TierUndelegate after a redelegation completion hook deletes mappings, causing `unbonding delegation` to diverge so the invariant `withdrawable unbonded funds remain in the position delegator until the owner-only withdrawal` fails and the attacker can leave stale position indexes so future claims or exits operate on deleted delegation state, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TierUndelegate
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTierUndelegate transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, position exit state, validator state
- Exploit idea: leave stale position indexes so future claims or exits operate on deleted delegation state by testing the owner binding angle against `unbonding delegation` during `call TierUndelegate after a redelegation completion hook deletes mappings`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: withdrawable unbonded funds remain in the position delegator until the owner-only withdrawal; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state-machine test over TriggerExitFromTier, TierUndelegate, staking unbonding, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
