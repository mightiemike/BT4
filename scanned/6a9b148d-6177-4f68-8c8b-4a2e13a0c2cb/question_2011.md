# Q2011: drain_modified_entries is not deterministic across nodes (loaded_programs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `drain_modified_entries` in `program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the compute units charged for the syscall disagree with the real CPU/memory work the syscall performs, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `drain_modified_entries` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs` -> `drain_modified_entries()` (around line 322)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `drain_modified_entries` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `drain_modified_entries` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `drain_modified_entries` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
