# Q1663: transferDelegationFromPosition owner binding against position shares

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then exit with amount just below full-exit threshold after slash, causing `position shares` to diverge so the invariant `shares removed from the position equal economic value delegated to the owner` fails and the attacker can create mismatch between transferredAmount event and actual owner delegation value, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgExitTierWithDelegation internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, redelegation state
- Exploit idea: create mismatch between transferredAmount event and actual owner delegation value by testing the owner binding angle against `position shares` during `exit with amount just below full-exit threshold after slash`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: shares removed from the position equal economic value delegated to the owner; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz test over amount/share boundaries around ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
