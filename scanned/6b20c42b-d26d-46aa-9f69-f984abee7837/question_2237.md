# Q2237: get-egroup via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) — which resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
