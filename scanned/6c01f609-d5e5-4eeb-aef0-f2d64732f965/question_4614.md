# Q4614: system-repay via liquidate: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `liquidate` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `collateral-receiver` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `system-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
