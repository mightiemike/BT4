# Q3041: Direct payload execution bypasses contract-level replay assumptions via Pre-Funded But Undeployed Uea / Target Uea Already Holds in msgServer.MigrateUEA

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `msgServer.MigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it submit payload material in a way that the Cosmos layer treats as new while the contract should not, breaking the invariant that a payload must not be executable more than once for one authorization intent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss via duplicate execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.MigrateUEA
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.MigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can submit payload material in a way that the Cosmos layer treats as new while the contract should not.
- Invariant to test: a payload must not be executable more than once for one authorization intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss via duplicate execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
