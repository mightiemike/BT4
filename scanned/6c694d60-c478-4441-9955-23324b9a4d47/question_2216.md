# Q2216: Invalid inbound still creates a visible UTX but misroutes recovery via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Inbound.NormalizeForTxType

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so that it drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state, breaking the invariant that failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.NormalizeForTxType
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.NormalizeForTxType` to collapse two security-relevant cases into one normalized form, so it can drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state.
- Invariant to test: failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
