# Q0212: linear-interpolate via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
