# Q0810: calc-index-next via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
