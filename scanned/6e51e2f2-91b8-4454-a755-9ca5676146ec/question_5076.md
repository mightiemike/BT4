# Q5076: interpolate-rate via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the future mask produced by the new debt bit across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
