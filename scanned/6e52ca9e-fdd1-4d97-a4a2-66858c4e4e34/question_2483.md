# Q2483: zip via liquidate-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
