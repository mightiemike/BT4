# Q0444: table key collision via `put_preimages` (state_db.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who sends transactions that cause the same key to be written by two different modules in one block, controlling the index or key an attacker-supplied field derives, drive `put_preimages` in `crates/sovereign-sdk/full-node/db/sov-db/src/state_db.rs` so that the entries two logical objects occupy and the distinct keys they should occupy stop being distinct, breaking the invariant that distinct objects never share a key?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sovereign-sdk/full-node/db/sov-db/src/state_db.rs` -> `put_preimages`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party sends transactions that cause the same key to be written by two different modules in one block
- Attacker controls: the index or key an attacker-supplied field derives
- Exploit idea: table key collision - reach `put_preimages` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the entries two logical objects occupy and the distinct keys they should occupy stop being distinct; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `StateDB`, `setup_schema_db`, `freeze`, `next_version`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: distinct objects never share a key
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: insert colliding objects and assert both survive
