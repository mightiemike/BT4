# Q3492: calculate-asset-notional-value via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `calculate-asset-notional-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
