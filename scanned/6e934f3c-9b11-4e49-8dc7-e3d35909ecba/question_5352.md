# Q5352: user-safe-mask via collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `user-safe-mask` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
