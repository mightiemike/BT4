# Q1913: find via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) — which resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the set of assets held, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
