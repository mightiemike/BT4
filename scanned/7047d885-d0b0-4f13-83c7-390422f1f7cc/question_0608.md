# Q0608: update_epoch_rewards_sysvar lets attacker data change the committed hash (sysvar.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `update_epoch_rewards_sysvar` in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/sysvar.rs` with values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker, and make the sysvar value cached for execution disagree with the sysvar account content committed to state, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/sysvar.rs` -> `update_epoch_rewards_sysvar()` (around line 75)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `update_epoch_rewards_sysvar` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
