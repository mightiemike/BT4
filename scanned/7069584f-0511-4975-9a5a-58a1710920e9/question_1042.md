# Q1042: ClaimTierRewards owner binding against base rewards

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClaimTierRewards` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim many positions around validator bond, unbond, and slash events, causing `base rewards` to diverge so the invariant `reward checkpoints advance monotonically with validator event sequence` fails and the attacker can drain reward pool by exploiting event reference counts or checkpoint updates, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClaimTierRewards
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClaimTierRewards transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionIds, ordering, validator events, claim batching
- Exploit idea: drain reward pool by exploiting event reference counts or checkpoint updates by testing the owner binding angle against `base rewards` during `claim many positions around validator bond, unbond, and slash events`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: reward checkpoints advance monotonically with validator event sequence; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz/state-machine test over ClaimTierRewards with validator events and repeated batches; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
