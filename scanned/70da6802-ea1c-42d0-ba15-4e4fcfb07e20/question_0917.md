# Q0917: Enabled-flag interpretation strands a live user flow via Chain Ids, Token Addresses, / Live Flow Will Look in GenesisState.Validate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows when the live flow will look up chain and token config before moving value, and cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config, breaking the invariant that enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/genesis.go::GenesisState.Validate
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows
- Exploit idea: Cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config.
- Invariant to test: enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
