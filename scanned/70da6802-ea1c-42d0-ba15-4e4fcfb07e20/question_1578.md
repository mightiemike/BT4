# Q1578: Ballot identity collision merges distinct observations via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Observation Outcome Changes Value-Moving in Keeper.ExpireBallotsBeforeHeight

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when the observation outcome changes a value-moving or liveness-critical path, and cause `Keeper.ExpireBallotsBeforeHeight` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id, breaking the invariant that one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/ballot.go::Keeper.ExpireBallotsBeforeHeight
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExpireBallotsBeforeHeight` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id.
- Invariant to test: one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
