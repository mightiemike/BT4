# Q2757: insert via repay: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) — which rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `repay` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
