# Q1220: oracle-price-legal via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `oracle-price-legal` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
