# Q2752: Nil request handling diverges across replicas via Public Grpc, Abci, Query / Validators Full Nodes Expose in Keeper.AllExpiredInbounds

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node with public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests when validators or full nodes expose the query surface publicly, and cause `Keeper.AllExpiredInbounds` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it trigger edge-case query errors that cause some nodes to panic while others return cleanly, breaking the invariant that query validation must behave deterministically and safely on malformed requests, and resulting in Widespread node crashes or consensus-disruptive overload?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/query_server.go::Keeper.AllExpiredInbounds
- Entrypoint: a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node
- Attacker controls: public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.AllExpiredInbounds` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can trigger edge-case query errors that cause some nodes to panic while others return cleanly.
- Invariant to test: query validation must behave deterministically and safely on malformed requests
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node crashes or consensus-disruptive overload
- Fast validation: write a query-server test or benchmark that sends the crafted public request pattern and measure iteration, allocation, and error behavior
