# Q1535: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-multi: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
