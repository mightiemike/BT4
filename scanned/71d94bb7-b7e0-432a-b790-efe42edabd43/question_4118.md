# Q4118: send-tokens via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
