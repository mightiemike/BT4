# Q2537: BurnNFT owner binding against IBC voucher backing

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `msgServer.BurnNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state, focusing on denom owner authority, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then burn an IBC voucher and trigger refund/mint path, causing `IBC voucher backing` to diverge so the invariant `burn removes token and all owner/collection indexes atomically` fails and the attacker can burn a victim or escrowed NFT and cause permanent user asset loss, leading to High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path moving or destroying NFTs contrary to signer intent?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.BurnNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgBurnNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state
- Exploit idea: burn a victim or escrowed NFT and cause permanent user asset loss by testing the owner binding angle against `IBC voucher backing` during `burn an IBC voucher and trigger refund/mint path`, with specific focus on denom owner authority.
- Invariant to test: burn removes token and all owner/collection indexes atomically; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path moving or destroying NFTs contrary to signer intent; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over BurnNFT plus nft-transfer refund and timeout state; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
