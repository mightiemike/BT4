# Q1469: ExitTierWithDelegation owner binding against position amount

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ExitTierWithDelegation` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, Amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then exit immediately after validator slash changes token-per-share, causing `position amount` to diverge so the invariant `transferred owner shares correspond exactly to unbonded position shares and transferred amount` fails and the attacker can full-exit while stale indexes or reward routing remain and claim again later, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ExitTierWithDelegation
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgExitTierWithDelegation transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, Amount, validator exchange rate, position shares
- Exploit idea: full-exit while stale indexes or reward routing remain and claim again later by testing the owner binding angle against `position amount` during `exit immediately after validator slash changes token-per-share`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: transferred owner shares correspond exactly to unbonded position shares and transferred amount; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test comparing staking shares and token balances before and after ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
