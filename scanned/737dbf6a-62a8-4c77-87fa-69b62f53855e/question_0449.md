# Q0449: Formatting-only variants bypass replay protection or split history via Fields Feed Directly Into / One Collision Split Would in Keeper.CreateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys when one collision or split would affect a value-moving lifecycle, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it represent the same logical event two ways so one path sees a replay and another sees a fresh action, breaking the invariant that derived-key logic must give one stable identity to one logical event across all callers, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can represent the same logical event two ways so one path sees a replay and another sees a fresh action.
- Invariant to test: derived-key logic must give one stable identity to one logical event across all callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
