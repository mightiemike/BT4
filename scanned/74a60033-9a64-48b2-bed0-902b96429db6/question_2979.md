# Q2979: insert via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
