# Q0107: Unprivileged chain-config creation bypasses authority via Chain Token Config Payloads / Config Change Would Immediately in Keeper.UpdateTokenConfig

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account when the config change would immediately affect live user flows if accepted, and cause `Keeper.UpdateTokenConfig` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it make an admin-gated registry write succeed from an unprivileged account, breaking the invariant that only the configured registry authority should mutate chain configuration, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds by malicious reconfiguration?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/msg_update_token_config.go::Keeper.UpdateTokenConfig
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateTokenConfig` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can make an admin-gated registry write succeed from an unprivileged account.
- Invariant to test: only the configured registry authority should mutate chain configuration
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds by malicious reconfiguration
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
