# Q1878: oversized blob accepted via `add_deposit_tx` (deposit_data_mempool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls the unauthenticated `citrea_sendRawDepositTransaction` with a hand-built deposit blob, controlling the entire `Bytes` deposit payload, drive `add_deposit_tx` in `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` so that the blob length the sequencer admits and the length the Bridge call can encode stop being compatible, breaking the invariant that an admitted deposit is always encodable into a block?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` -> `add_deposit_tx`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls the unauthenticated `citrea_sendRawDepositTransaction` with a hand-built deposit blob
- Attacker controls: the entire `Bytes` deposit payload
- Exploit idea: oversized blob accepted - reach `add_deposit_tx` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the blob length the sequencer admits and the length the Bridge call can encode stop being compatible; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `DepositDataMempool`, `make_deposit_tx_from_data`, `fetch_deposits`, `remove_deposits`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: an admitted deposit is always encodable into a block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - network unable to confirm new transactions (settlement halt) triggered by attacker-shaped protocol data
- Fast validation: submit a maximal blob and assert block production still completes
