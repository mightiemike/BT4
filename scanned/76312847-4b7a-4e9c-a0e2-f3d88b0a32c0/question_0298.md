# Q298: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against position indexes

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit to a tier while validator status or token-per-share rate changes in the same test sequence, causing `position indexes` to diverge so the invariant `position ownership and withdraw address remain bound to the delegator signer` fails and the attacker can set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `position indexes` during `commit to a tier while validator status or token-per-share rate changes in the same test sequence`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: position ownership and withdraw address remain bound to the delegator signer; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
