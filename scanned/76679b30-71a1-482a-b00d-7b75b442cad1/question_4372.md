# Q4372: debt-remove-scaled via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
