# Q1253: add-user-collateral via collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling call ordering within the block, drive `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) — which adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with call ordering within the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
