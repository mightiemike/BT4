# Q2189: next-liquidity-index via redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling `amount` of shares burned, drive `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) — which rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` of shares burned, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
