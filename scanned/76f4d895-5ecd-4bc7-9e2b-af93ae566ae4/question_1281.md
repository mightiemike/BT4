# Q1281: find-superset via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) — which returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-superset` touches, run `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
