# Q4558: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
