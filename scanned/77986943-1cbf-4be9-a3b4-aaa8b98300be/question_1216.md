# Q1216: Ballot hook updates the wrong pending record via Vote-Bearing Messages If Signer / Honest Uvs Later Vote in MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make terminal hook logic remove or mutate a different inbound/outbound than the ballot just finalized, breaking the invariant that ballot side effects must remain bound to the exact observation that finalized, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_remove_universal_validator.go::MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make terminal hook logic remove or mutate a different inbound/outbound than the ballot just finalized.
- Invariant to test: ballot side effects must remain bound to the exact observation that finalized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
