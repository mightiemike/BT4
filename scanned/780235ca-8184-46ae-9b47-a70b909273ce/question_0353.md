# Q0353: l1 fee field in RPC output via `storage_set` (provider_functions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who queries a slot it wrote at `pending`, `latest` and a block hash tag, controlling the block tag (`latest`/`pending`/hash), drive `storage_set` in `crates/evm/src/provider_functions.rs` so that the L1 fee reported in a transaction receipt and the L1 fee charged during execution stop being equal, breaking the invariant that reported fees equal charged fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/provider_functions.rs` -> `storage_set`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party queries a slot it wrote at `pending`, `latest` and a block hash tag
- Attacker controls: the block tag (`latest`/`pending`/hash)
- Exploit idea: l1 fee field in RPC output - reach `storage_set` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the L1 fee reported in a transaction receipt and the L1 fee charged during execution stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `account_exists`, `account_info`, `account_set`, `get_storage_address`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: reported fees equal charged fees
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - node serves state contradicting the proved chain to bridges, exchanges and Clementine operators
- Fast validation: diff receipt fields against `TxInfo` for adversarial calldata
