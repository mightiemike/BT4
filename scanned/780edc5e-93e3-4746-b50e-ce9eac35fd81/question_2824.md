# Q2824: createOutgoingPacket source sink direction against tokenURIs

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.createOutgoingPacket` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling classID, tokenIDs, sender, receiver, focusing on escrow custody, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then create packet after transferring ownership just before send, causing `tokenURIs` to diverge so the invariant `all token ownership changes are atomic with packet creation success` fails and the attacker can partially escrow or burn tokens before an error and leave assets stuck or duplicated, leading to Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/packet.go::Keeper.createOutgoingPacket
- Entrypoint: MsgTransfer through Keeper.SendTransfer
- Attacker controls: classID, tokenIDs, sender, receiver, source channel, destination channel, timeout
- Exploit idea: partially escrow or burn tokens before an error and leave assets stuck or duplicated by testing the source sink direction angle against `tokenURIs` during `create packet after transferring ownership just before send`, with specific focus on escrow custody.
- Invariant to test: all token ownership changes are atomic with packet creation success; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test directly invoking SendTransfer with multi-token packets and class trace setup; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
