# Q3943: process-collateral-asset via liquidate-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`process-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789) computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789` -> `process-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `process-collateral-asset` computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, then read `process-collateral-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
