# Q2120: accrue-user-collateral via accrue: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `accrue` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
