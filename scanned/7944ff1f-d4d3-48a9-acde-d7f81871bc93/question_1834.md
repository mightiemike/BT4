# Q1834: processEventsAndClaimBonus owner binding against validator event ref counts

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim repeatedly when totalBonus truncates around integer boundaries, causing `validator event ref counts` to diverge so the invariant `slash events update token-per-share math without double counting time` fails and the attacker can double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/claim_rewards.go::Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus
- Entrypoint: ClaimTierRewards and position lifecycle reward claims
- Attacker controls: claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, delegation shares
- Exploit idea: double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq by testing the owner binding angle against `validator event ref counts` during `claim repeatedly when totalBonus truncates around integer boundaries`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: slash events update token-per-share math without double counting time; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: state-machine keeper test with synthetic validator events and reward pool balance checks; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
