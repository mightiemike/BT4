# Q0195: calc-utilization via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-utilization` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
