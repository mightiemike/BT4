# Q1168: mask-to-list-iter via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
