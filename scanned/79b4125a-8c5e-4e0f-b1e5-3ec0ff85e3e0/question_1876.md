# Q1876: Unprivileged chain-config update bypasses authority via Direct Submission Of Admin- / Config Change Would Immediately in msgServer.UpdateParams

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message when the config change would immediately affect live user flows if accepted, and cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it modify live chain settings without already controlling the admin or governance path, breaking the invariant that only authorized actors should be able to change chain enablement, gateways, or confirmations, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.UpdateParams
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can modify live chain settings without already controlling the admin or governance path.
- Invariant to test: only authorized actors should be able to change chain enablement, gateways, or confirmations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
