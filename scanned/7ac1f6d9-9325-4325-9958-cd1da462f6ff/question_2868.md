# Q2868: check-confidence via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `check-confidence` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
