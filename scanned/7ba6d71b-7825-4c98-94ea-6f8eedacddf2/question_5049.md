# Q5049: convert-to-scaled-debt via supply-collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) — which scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-scaled-debt` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
