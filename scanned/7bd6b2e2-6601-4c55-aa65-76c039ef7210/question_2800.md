# Q2800: zip via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls call ordering within the block reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
