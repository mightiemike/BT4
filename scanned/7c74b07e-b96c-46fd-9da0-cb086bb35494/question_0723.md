# Q0723: Decimals or native-representation mismatch corrupts amount semantics via Cross-Chain Actions Depend On / Same Asset May Appear in VaultMethods.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with cross-chain actions that depend on enabled flags, decimals, or native-representation fields when the same asset may appear in multiple encodings or address formats, and cause `VaultMethods.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it route a normal user deposit or refund through the wrong decimal or native-representation assumptions, breaking the invariant that registry amount semantics must preserve the same real asset quantity end to end, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/vault_methods.go::VaultMethods.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: cross-chain actions that depend on enabled flags, decimals, or native-representation fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `VaultMethods.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can route a normal user deposit or refund through the wrong decimal or native-representation assumptions.
- Invariant to test: registry amount semantics must preserve the same real asset quantity end to end
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
