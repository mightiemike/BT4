# Q2118: simulation/execution gas divergence via `publish_test_block` (rpc.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who submits a deposit blob whose `eth_call` simulation succeeds against current state but not at inclusion height, controlling the `calc_tx_id` preimage, drive `publish_test_block` in `crates/sequencer/src/rpc.rs` so that the gas the admission simulation charged and the gas the block execution charges stop being the same, breaking the invariant that admission implies executability under `SYSTEM_TX_GAS_LIMIT`?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sequencer/src/rpc.rs` -> `publish_test_block`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party submits a deposit blob whose `eth_call` simulation succeeds against current state but not at inclusion height
- Attacker controls: the `calc_tx_id` preimage
- Exploit idea: simulation/execution gas divergence - reach `publish_test_block` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the gas the admission simulation charged and the gas the block execution charges stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `RpcContext`, `SequencerRpc`, `SequencerRpcServerImpl`, `create_rpc_context`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: admission implies executability under `SYSTEM_TX_GAS_LIMIT`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds (recovery requires a hard fork)
- Fast validation: craft a blob whose gas use grows with state and assert inclusion still succeeds
