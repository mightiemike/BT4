# Q4299: resolve-pyth via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-pyth` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
