# Q1653: find-and-resolve-asset-value via collateral-add: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) — which reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `collateral-add` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-and-resolve-asset-value` touches, run `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
