# Q3888: uint-to-list-u64 via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it expands a bitmap into a 64-element list, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `uint-to-list-u64` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
