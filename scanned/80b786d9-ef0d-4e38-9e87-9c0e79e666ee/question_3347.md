# Q3347: Unauthenticated query can walk too much state via Public Grpc, Abci, Query / Queried Collection Can Grow in Querier.AllFinalizedBallots

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node with public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests when the queried collection can grow under normal protocol use, and cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it use public query parameters to force an unbounded or unexpectedly large state walk, breaking the invariant that public query surfaces must remain bounded enough that one client cannot overload nodes materially, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/query_server.go::Querier.AllFinalizedBallots
- Entrypoint: a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node
- Attacker controls: public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests
- Exploit idea: Cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can use public query parameters to force an unbounded or unexpectedly large state walk.
- Invariant to test: public query surfaces must remain bounded enough that one client cannot overload nodes materially
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a query-server test or benchmark that sends the crafted public request pattern and measure iteration, allocation, and error behavior
