# Q3130: write-feeds via call-ststx-ratio: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
