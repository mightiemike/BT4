# Q2536: Migration record selection binds the wrong chain or old key via User-Created Outbound Flow Eventually / Pending-State Cleanup Is Necessary in GenesisState.Validate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state when pending-state cleanup is necessary to keep funds recoverable, and cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended, breaking the invariant that each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/genesis.go::GenesisState.Validate
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state
- Exploit idea: Cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make a migration outcome update a different chain/key pair than intended.
- Invariant to test: each migration result must remain bound to one exact key-chain pair
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
