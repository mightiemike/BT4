# Q5934: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
