# Q1817: Ballot identity collision finalizes the wrong inbound variant via Source-Chain Fields Such As / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.ExecuteInboundGas

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload` when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundGas` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds, breaking the invariant that one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/execute_inbound_gas.go::Keeper.ExecuteInboundGas
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecuteInboundGas` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make honest UVs converge on one ballot for two semantically different inbounds.
- Invariant to test: one ballot key must represent only one execution-relevant inbound meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freeze after wrong finalization
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
