# Q1312: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against position delegator spendable coins

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then withdraw after partial ExitTierWithDelegation leaves dust in the delegator account, causing `position delegator spendable coins` to diverge so the invariant `withdraw requires owner, triggered exit, completed exit duration, no active delegation, and no unbonding` fails and the attacker can leave reward routing after deletion and redirect future distribution rewards, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: leave reward routing after deletion and redirect future distribution rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `position delegator spendable coins` during `withdraw after partial ExitTierWithDelegation leaves dust in the delegator account`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: withdraw requires owner, triggered exit, completed exit duration, no active delegation, and no unbonding; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
