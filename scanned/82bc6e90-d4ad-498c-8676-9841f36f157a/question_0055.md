# Q0055: Derived-key collision merges independent user flows via Values Become Identical Only / Derived Id Gates Replay in Keeper.CreateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization when the derived id gates replay protection, attachment, or finalization, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it make two distinct logical records hash to one derived key because canonicalization is too weak, breaking the invariant that derived ids must uniquely represent one logical security object only, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can make two distinct logical records hash to one derived key because canonicalization is too weak.
- Invariant to test: derived ids must uniquely represent one logical security object only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
