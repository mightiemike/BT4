# Q0487: Event cleanup delete - payload row dedupe bypass

## Question
When an unprivileged actor submit a normal inbound transfer whose parsed event reaches the local event database, does `DeleteTerminalEvents` remain safe if they control the exact `EventData` JSON and any `vote_tx_hash` written after processing attacker-controlled traffic, or can that make it bypass local deduplication and make the same user action exist as multiple live rows with different downstream outcomes, violate the rule that one user-visible bridge action can have at most one authoritative live row at a time, and end in direct theft or loss of substantial user funds through an unauthorized cross-chain execution?

## Target
- File/function: universalClient/chains/common/chain_store.go:DeleteTerminalEvents
- Entrypoint: submit a normal inbound transfer whose parsed event reaches the local event database
- Attacker controls: the exact `EventData` JSON and any `vote_tx_hash` written after processing attacker-controlled traffic
- Exploit idea: bypass local deduplication and make the same user action exist as multiple live rows with different downstream outcomes
- Invariant to test: one user-visible bridge action can have at most one authoritative live row at a time
- Expected Immunefi impact: direct theft or loss of substantial user funds through an unauthorized cross-chain execution
- Fast validation: run two validators or two workers against the same flow, then inspect sqlite rows for duplicate `EventID`s, stale status writes, or missing `vote_tx_hash` values
