# Q1680: transferDelegationFromPosition owner binding against unbonded shares

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then exit after validator exchange rate changes from rewards or slashing, causing `unbonded shares` to diverge so the invariant `active redelegation blocks transfer out` fails and the attacker can create mismatch between transferredAmount event and actual owner delegation value, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgExitTierWithDelegation internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, redelegation state
- Exploit idea: create mismatch between transferredAmount event and actual owner delegation value by testing the owner binding angle against `unbonded shares` during `exit after validator exchange rate changes from rewards or slashing`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: active redelegation blocks transfer out; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz test over amount/share boundaries around ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
