# Q78: LockTier owner binding against PositionCountByValidator

## Question
Can unprivileged owner account enter through `msgServer.LockTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then lock exactly tier minimum amount, then trigger validator status and reward checkpoint changes before claim, causing `PositionCountByValidator` to diverge so the invariant `created position owner, delegator address, tier id, validator, and distribution withdraw address remain bound to the signer` fails and the attacker can capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.LockTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgLockTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: capture base rewards by corrupting the distribution withdraw address for the position delegator by testing the owner binding angle against `PositionCountByValidator` during `lock exactly tier minimum amount, then trigger validator status and reward checkpoint changes before claim`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: created position owner, delegator address, tier id, validator, and distribution withdraw address remain bound to the signer; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test around LockTier plus bank, staking, distribution, and tieredrewards stores; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
