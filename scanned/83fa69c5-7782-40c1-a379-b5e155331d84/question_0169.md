# Q169: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against validator shares

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit with TriggerExitImmediately and then attempt claim, undelegate, or withdrawal follow-up, causing `validator shares` to diverge so the invariant `committed stake cannot skip exit duration or min-lock rules` fails and the attacker can use rounding to create a position that can claim rewards or voting power without locked value, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: use rounding to create a position that can claim rewards or voting power without locked value by testing the owner binding angle against `validator shares` during `commit with TriggerExitImmediately and then attempt claim, undelegate, or withdrawal follow-up`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: committed stake cannot skip exit duration or min-lock rules; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
