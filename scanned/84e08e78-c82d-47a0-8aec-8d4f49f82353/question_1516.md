# Q1516: Wrong chain-meta values distort refund or gas-fee settlement via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows, breaking the invariant that gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows.
- Invariant to test: gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
