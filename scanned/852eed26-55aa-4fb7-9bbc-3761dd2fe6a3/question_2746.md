# Q2746: Oversized payload-ish fields pass basic checks and later overload execution via Whitespace, Padding, Casing, Zero-Value / Later Execution Assumes Basic in Params.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later when later execution assumes basic validation already ruled the dangerous case out, and cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it submit large data that validation accepts even though live processing must fully decode or iterate it, breaking the invariant that validation must keep public inputs from becoming chain-execution DoS vectors, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/params.go::Params.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later
- Exploit idea: Cause `Params.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can submit large data that validation accepts even though live processing must fully decode or iterate it.
- Invariant to test: validation must keep public inputs from becoming chain-execution DoS vectors
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
