# Q1315: WithdrawFromTier owner binding against owner balance

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.WithdrawFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then send extra coins to the position delegator before withdrawal and verify sweep behavior, causing `owner balance` to diverge so the invariant `position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal` fails and the attacker can withdraw another user's unlocked delegator balance by supplying their PositionId, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.WithdrawFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgWithdrawFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, delegator spendable balance, unbonding state
- Exploit idea: withdraw another user's unlocked delegator balance by supplying their PositionId by testing the owner binding angle against `owner balance` during `send extra coins to the position delegator before withdrawal and verify sweep behavior`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: position and secondary indexes are deleted exactly once after withdrawal; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test with staking unbonding completion and bank balance assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
