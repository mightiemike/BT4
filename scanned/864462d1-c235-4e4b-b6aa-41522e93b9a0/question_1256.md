# Q1256: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order varied, and assert that the value `accrue-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
