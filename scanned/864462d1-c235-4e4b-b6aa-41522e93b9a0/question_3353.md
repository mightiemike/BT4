# Q3353: total-assets-preview via transfer: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling `amount`, drive `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) — which re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `transfer` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
