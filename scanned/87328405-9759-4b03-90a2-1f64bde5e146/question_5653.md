# Q5653: normalize-pyth via liquidate-multi: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) — which computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint` — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), then read `normalize-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
