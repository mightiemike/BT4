# Q1051: is_snapshot_fastboot_compatible can serve state that disagrees with the cache (snapshot_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `is_snapshot_fastboot_compatible` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make the blockhash queue entry used for age checks disagree with the blockhash the transaction actually referenced, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` -> `is_snapshot_fastboot_compatible()` (around line 369)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Make `is_snapshot_fastboot_compatible` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
