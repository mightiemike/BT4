# Q2410: debt-remove-scaled via transfer: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `transfer` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
