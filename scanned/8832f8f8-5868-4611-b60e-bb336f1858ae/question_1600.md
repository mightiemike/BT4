# Q1600: mask-to-list-internal via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
