# Q1425: Payload-carrying inbound spawns the wrong outbound context via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Inbound Will Create Visible in Keeper.RecordInboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when the inbound will create a visible UTX even if execution validation fails, and cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction, breaking the invariant that outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/inbound.go::Keeper.RecordInboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can make execution from one inbound attach outbounds or rescue state to another logical transaction.
- Invariant to test: outbounds must remain attached to the exact inbound that created them
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of bridged funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
