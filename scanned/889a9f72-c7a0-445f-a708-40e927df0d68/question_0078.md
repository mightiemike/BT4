# Q0078: active via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `active` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
