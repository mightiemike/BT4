# Q3760: iter-lookup-collateral via repay: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `repay` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
