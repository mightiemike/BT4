# Q3112: ledger iteration order via `tables` (tables.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes data that lands in a persisted table keyed by an attacker-influenced index, controlling the index or key an attacker-supplied field derives, drive `tables` in `crates/sovereign-sdk/full-node/db/sov-db/src/schema/tables.rs` so that the order an iterator yields entries and the order the schema defines stop being the same, breaking the invariant that iteration order is schema-determined?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sovereign-sdk/full-node/db/sov-db/src/schema/tables.rs` -> `tables`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes data that lands in a persisted table keyed by an attacker-influenced index
- Attacker controls: the index or key an attacker-supplied field derives
- Exploit idea: ledger iteration order - reach `tables` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the order an iterator yields entries and the order the schema defines stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are none adjacent, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: iteration order is schema-determined
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: insert adversarial keys and assert stable ordering
