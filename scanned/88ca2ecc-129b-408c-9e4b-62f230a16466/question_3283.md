# Q3283: system event ordering versus user txs via `populate_set_block_info_event` (hooks.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA, controlling value and gas, drive `populate_set_block_info_event` in `crates/evm/src/hooks.rs` so that the position system events occupy in the block and the position the STF assumes stop being the same, breaking the invariant that system events are first-class and fixed in order?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/hooks.rs` -> `populate_set_block_info_event`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA
- Attacker controls: value and gas
- Exploit idea: system event ordering versus user txs - reach `populate_set_block_info_event` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the position system events occupy in the block and the position the STF assumes stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `begin_l2_block_hook`, `end_l2_block_hook`, `finalize_hook`, `create_initial_system_events`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: system events are first-class and fixed in order
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: interleave and re-execute the block
