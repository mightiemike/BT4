# Q5927: next-index via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
