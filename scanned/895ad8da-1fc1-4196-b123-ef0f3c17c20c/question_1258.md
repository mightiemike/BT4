# Q1258: num_instructions is not deterministic across nodes (transaction_cost.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `num_instructions` in `cost-model/src/transaction_cost.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the loaded-accounts-data-size counted during loading disagree with the bytes actually loaded and charged, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `num_instructions` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/transaction_cost.rs` -> `num_instructions()` (around line 124)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Find input to `num_instructions` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `num_instructions` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `num_instructions` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
