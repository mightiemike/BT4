# Q3291: add-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `add-user-collateral` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
