# Q4760: linear-interpolate via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
