# Q4497: accrue-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) — which calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-debt-asset` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
