# Q5819: total-debt via redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
