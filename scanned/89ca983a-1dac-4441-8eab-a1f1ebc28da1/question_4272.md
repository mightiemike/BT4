# Q4272: calc-treasury-lp-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-treasury-lp-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
