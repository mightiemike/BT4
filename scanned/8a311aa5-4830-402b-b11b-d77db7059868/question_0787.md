# Q0787: WCBTC wrap/unwrap conservation via `empty_code` (genesis.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA, controlling contract bytecode and calldata, drive `empty_code` in `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` so that the cBTC locked by wrapping and the cBTC released by unwrapping stop being equal, breaking the invariant that wrapped supply equals locked supply?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/genesis.rs` -> `empty_code`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA
- Attacker controls: contract bytecode and calldata
- Exploit idea: WCBTC wrap/unwrap conservation - reach `empty_code` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the cBTC locked by wrapping and the cBTC released by unwrapping stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `AccountData`, `AccountDataHelper`, `EvmConfig`, `balance`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: wrapped supply equals locked supply
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user or vault funds
- Fast validation: wrap and unwrap adversarially and assert conservation
