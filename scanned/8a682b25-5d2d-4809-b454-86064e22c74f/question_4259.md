# Q4259: vault-system-borrow via liquidate-multi: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
