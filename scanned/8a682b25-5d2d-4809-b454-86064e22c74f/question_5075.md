# Q5075: accrue-user-collateral via repay: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `repay` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
