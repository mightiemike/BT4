# Q0324: call-liquidate via liquidate-multi: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `call-liquidate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
