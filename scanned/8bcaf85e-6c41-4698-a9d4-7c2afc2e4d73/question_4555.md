# Q4555: oracle-price-legal via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `oracle-price-legal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
