# Q5104: resolve-price-feed via call-ststx-ratio: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
