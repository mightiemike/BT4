# Q0976: Nil-vs-empty semantics collapse distinct recovery behavior via Oversized Payload Numeric Fields / Object Can Reach Value-Moving in UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with oversized payload or numeric fields that pass basic validation but stress later execution when the object can reach a value-moving or liveness-critical path after validation, and cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use empty-but-present fields that later mean something different from nil, breaking the invariant that validation must preserve distinctions that affect refund, revert, or ownership behavior, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/universal_account_id.go::UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: oversized payload or numeric fields that pass basic validation but stress later execution
- Exploit idea: Cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use empty-but-present fields that later mean something different from nil.
- Invariant to test: validation must preserve distinctions that affect refund, revert, or ownership behavior
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
