# Q1059: Gas deduction rollback boundary leaves execution without correct charge via Payload Fields Such As / Payload Can Emit Receipt in Keeper.DeployUEAV2

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the payload can emit receipt logs that create outbounds or rescues, and cause `Keeper.DeployUEAV2` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails, breaking the invariant that either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/deploy_uea.go::Keeper.DeployUEAV2
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeployUEAV2` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails.
- Invariant to test: either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
