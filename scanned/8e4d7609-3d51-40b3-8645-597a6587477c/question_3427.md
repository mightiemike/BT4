# Q3427: Pre-funded undeployed UEA auto-deploys under the wrong identity via Gasless Msgexecutepayload Msgmigrateuea Chosen / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in Keeper.CallUEAMigrateUEA

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData` when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `Keeper.CallUEAMigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it use pre-funding and address derivation edge cases to make auto-deploy claim or execute the wrong account, breaking the invariant that auto-deploy must bind pre-funded value to exactly one intended universal account identity, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/evm.go::Keeper.CallUEAMigrateUEA
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CallUEAMigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can use pre-funding and address derivation edge cases to make auto-deploy claim or execute the wrong account.
- Invariant to test: auto-deploy must bind pre-funded value to exactly one intended universal account identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
