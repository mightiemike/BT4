# Q2589: copy_from_slice confuses account types or owners (packet.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `copy_from_slice` in `perf/src/packet.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and have `copy_from_slice` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`copy_from_slice` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `perf/src/packet.rs` -> `copy_from_slice()` (around line 146)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `copy_from_slice` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `copy_from_slice` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `copy_from_slice` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
