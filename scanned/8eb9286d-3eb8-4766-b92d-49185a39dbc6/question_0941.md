# Q0941: check-confidence via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) — which compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
