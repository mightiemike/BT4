# Q5127: unwrap-status via collateral-remove: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`unwrap-status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111) resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111` -> `unwrap-status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `unwrap-status` resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `unwrap-status` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
