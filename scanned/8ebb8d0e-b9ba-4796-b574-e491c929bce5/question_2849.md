# Q2849: start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader can be driven into unbounded work (poh_recorder.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` in `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` -> `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader()` (around line 892)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `start_slot_was_mine_or_previous_leader` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
