# Q3490: Bootstrap median can be defined from an attacker-manipulated vote set via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends, breaking the invariant that initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeductAndBurnFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends.
- Invariant to test: initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
