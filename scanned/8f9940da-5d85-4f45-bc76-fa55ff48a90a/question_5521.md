# Q5521: relevant via supply-collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) — which drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `relevant` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
