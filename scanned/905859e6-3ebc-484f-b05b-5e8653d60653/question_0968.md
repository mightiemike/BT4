# Q0968: resolve-dia via call-ststx-ratio: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `resolve-dia` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
