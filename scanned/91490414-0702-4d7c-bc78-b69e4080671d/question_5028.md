# Q5028: subset via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it tests bitmask containment, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `subset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
