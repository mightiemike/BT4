# Q2550: Nil-vs-empty semantics collapse distinct recovery behavior via Whitespace, Padding, Casing, Zero-Value / Same Field Is Later in PCTx.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later when the same field is later canonicalized or decoded more aggressively, and cause `PCTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use empty-but-present fields that later mean something different from nil, breaking the invariant that validation must preserve distinctions that affect refund, revert, or ownership behavior, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/pc_tx.go::PCTx.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later
- Exploit idea: Cause `PCTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use empty-but-present fields that later mean something different from nil.
- Invariant to test: validation must preserve distinctions that affect refund, revert, or ownership behavior
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
