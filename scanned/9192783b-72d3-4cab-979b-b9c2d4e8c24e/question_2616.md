# Q2616: Revert or rescue ids can collide with live outbound ids via Fields Feed Directly Into / Derived Id Gates Replay in Keeper.CreateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys when the derived id gates replay protection, attachment, or finalization, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it shape values so special-case ids overlap normal outbounds or vice versa, breaking the invariant that special recovery ids must be unambiguously separate from normal outbound identities, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTx` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can shape values so special-case ids overlap normal outbounds or vice versa.
- Invariant to test: special recovery ids must be unambiguously separate from normal outbound identities
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
