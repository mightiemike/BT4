# Q2002: find-and-resolve-asset-value via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
