# Q5816: write-feeds via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `borrower`, any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `write-feeds` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
