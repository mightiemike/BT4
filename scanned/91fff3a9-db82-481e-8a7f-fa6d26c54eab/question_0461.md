# Q0461: get-cached-indexes via collateral-remove-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) — which reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
