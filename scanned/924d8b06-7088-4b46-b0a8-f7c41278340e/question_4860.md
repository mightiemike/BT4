# Q4860: accrue-user-debts via liquidate-multi: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
