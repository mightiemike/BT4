# Q3592: Normalization removes the field that distinguishes safe from unsafe execution via Source-Chain Fields Such As / Attacker Can Create Multiple in Keeper.RecordInboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload` when the attacker can create multiple formatting variants of one logical event, and cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it strip or rewrite a field so a malicious inbound survives into the wrong execution branch, breaking the invariant that normalization must preserve every field needed to keep authorization and asset semantics intact, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or unauthorized execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/inbound.go::Keeper.RecordInboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can strip or rewrite a field so a malicious inbound survives into the wrong execution branch.
- Invariant to test: normalization must preserve every field needed to keep authorization and asset semantics intact
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or unauthorized execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
