# Q5331: resolve via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
