# Q3472: iter-find-superset via collateral-add: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it short-circuits on the first superset match, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `collateral-add` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
