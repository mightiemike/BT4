# Q2804: Lenient source-chain address canonicalization misbinds sender or asset via Source-Chain Gateway Event Attacker / Failed Inbound Should Still in Keeper.RecordInboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it present source-chain fields in a format that maps to the wrong sender or asset once canonicalized, breaking the invariant that canonicalization must not let one user-controlled formatting variant steal another asset or identity, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/inbound.go::Keeper.RecordInboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: a source-chain gateway event the attacker can trigger through a normal deposit or bridge action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can present source-chain fields in a format that maps to the wrong sender or asset once canonicalized.
- Invariant to test: canonicalization must not let one user-controlled formatting variant steal another asset or identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
