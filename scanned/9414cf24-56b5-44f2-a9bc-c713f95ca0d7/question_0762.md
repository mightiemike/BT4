# Q0762: interest-rate via liquidate-multi: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
