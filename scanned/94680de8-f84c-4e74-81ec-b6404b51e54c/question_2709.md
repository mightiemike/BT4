# Q2709: SendTransfer source sink direction against voucher burn state

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.SendTransfer` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, focusing on voucher backing, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then send a native NFT away from origin and then process timeout, causing `voucher burn state` to diverge so the invariant `next sequence and packet data cannot be reused to refund twice` fails and the attacker can reuse packet lifecycle state to trigger both timeout refund and ack refund, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/relay.go::Keeper.SendTransfer
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransfer for nft-transfer
- Attacker controls: SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, Sender, Receiver, timeout height, timeout timestamp
- Exploit idea: reuse packet lifecycle state to trigger both timeout refund and ack refund by testing the source sink direction angle against `voucher burn state` during `send a native NFT away from origin and then process timeout`, with specific focus on voucher backing.
- Invariant to test: next sequence and packet data cannot be reused to refund twice; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: IBC app test over SendTransfer, createOutgoingPacket, OnAcknowledgementPacket, and OnTimeoutPacket; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
