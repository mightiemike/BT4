# Q1157: compute_unit_price_in_microlamports arithmetic overflows on reachable values (transaction_meta.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` in `runtime-transaction/src/transaction_meta.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and make the arithmetic in `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/transaction_meta.rs` -> `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports()` (around line 77)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
