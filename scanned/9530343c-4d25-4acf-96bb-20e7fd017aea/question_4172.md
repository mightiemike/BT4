# Q4172: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the set of assets held varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
