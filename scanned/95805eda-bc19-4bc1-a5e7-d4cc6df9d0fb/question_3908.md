# Q3908: Authz wrapping weakens TSS authority checks via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Accepted Tss State Would in MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when accepted TSS state would affect live outbound signing or migration, and cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks, breaking the invariant that wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_update_params.go::MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks.
- Invariant to test: wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
