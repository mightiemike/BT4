# Q3036: accrue via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
