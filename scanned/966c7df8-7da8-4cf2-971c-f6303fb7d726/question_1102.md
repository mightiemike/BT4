# Q1102: Signer derivation and declared authority can be split via Signer Authz Wrapper Crafted / Message Is Directly User-Submittable in MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with a signer or authz wrapper crafted to confuse authority checks on registry mutations when the message is directly user-submittable over normal transaction channels, and cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make the message look authorized while the actual signer is different, breaking the invariant that registry message authority checks must bind the signer to the declared authority field exactly, and resulting in Unprivileged takeover of registry control leading to fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_update_params.go::MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: a signer or authz wrapper crafted to confuse authority checks on registry mutations
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make the message look authorized while the actual signer is different.
- Invariant to test: registry message authority checks must bind the signer to the declared authority field exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unprivileged takeover of registry control leading to fund loss
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
