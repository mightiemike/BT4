# Q2553: BurnNFT owner binding against owner index

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `msgServer.BurnNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state, focusing on token owner authority, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then burn after transfer in the same block ordering model, causing `owner index` to diverge so the invariant `authz and feegrant cannot burn a token outside the granted owner authority` fails and the attacker can burn a victim or escrowed NFT and cause permanent user asset loss, leading to Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.BurnNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgBurnNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state
- Exploit idea: burn a victim or escrowed NFT and cause permanent user asset loss by testing the owner binding angle against `owner index` during `burn after transfer in the same block ordering model`, with specific focus on token owner authority.
- Invariant to test: authz and feegrant cannot burn a token outside the granted owner authority; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over BurnNFT plus nft-transfer refund and timeout state; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
