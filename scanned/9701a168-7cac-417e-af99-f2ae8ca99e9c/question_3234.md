# Q3234: insert via transfer: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `transfer` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `insert` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
