# Q1930: simd185_field_offset result depends on batch ordering (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `simd185_field_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the committed result depend on the scheduler's internal ordering rather than the block order, so that the invariant "Committed state is a function of the block's transaction order, not the scheduler's internal order." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `simd185_field_offset()` (around line 294)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Submit conflicting transactions in one batch so `simd185_field_offset` produces a different commit depending on scheduling order that is not fixed by the block.
- Invariant to test: Committed state is a function of the block's transaction order, not the scheduler's internal order.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Execute the same batch under several scheduler orderings and assert one identical resulting bank hash.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
