# Q0539: get-asset-value via liquidate: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
