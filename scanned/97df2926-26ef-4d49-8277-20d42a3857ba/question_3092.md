# Q3092: create via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
