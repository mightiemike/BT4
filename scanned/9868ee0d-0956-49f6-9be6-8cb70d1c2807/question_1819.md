# Q1819: processEventsAndClaimBonus owner binding against LastBonusAccrual

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim repeatedly when totalBonus truncates around integer boundaries, causing `LastBonusAccrual` to diverge so the invariant `slash events update token-per-share math without double counting time` fails and the attacker can double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/claim_rewards.go::Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus
- Entrypoint: ClaimTierRewards and position lifecycle reward claims
- Attacker controls: claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, delegation shares
- Exploit idea: double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq by testing the owner binding angle against `LastBonusAccrual` during `claim repeatedly when totalBonus truncates around integer boundaries`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: slash events update token-per-share math without double counting time; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: state-machine keeper test with synthetic validator events and reward pool balance checks; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
