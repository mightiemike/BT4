# Q0123: accrue-and-cache via liquidate-multi: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-and-cache` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
