# Q3172: get-liquidation-position via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
