# Q2640: Gas deduction rollback boundary leaves execution without correct charge via Gasless Msgexecutepayload Msgmigrateuea Chosen / Target Uea Already Holds in Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData` when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails, breaking the invariant that either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/evm.go::Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CallUniversalCoreRefundUnusedGas` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails.
- Invariant to test: either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
