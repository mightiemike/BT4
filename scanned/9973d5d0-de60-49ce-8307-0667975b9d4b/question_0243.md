# Q0243: calc-cumulative-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) multiplies scaled principal by an index. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-cumulative-debt` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
