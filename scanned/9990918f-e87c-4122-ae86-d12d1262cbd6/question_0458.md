# Q0458: socialize-debt via repay: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `repay` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `socialize-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
