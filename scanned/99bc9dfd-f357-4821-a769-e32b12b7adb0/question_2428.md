# Q2428: debt-add-scaled via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
