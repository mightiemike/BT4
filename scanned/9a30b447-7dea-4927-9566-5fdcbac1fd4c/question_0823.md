# Q0823: iter-lookup-collateral via repay: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `repay` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `iter-lookup-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
