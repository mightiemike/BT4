# Q4329: lookup via collateral-remove: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) — which returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `lookup` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
