# Q3997: Cross-chain tx-hash canonicalization merges unrelated events via Values Become Identical Only / One Collision Split Would in GetOutboundRevertId

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization when one collision or split would affect a value-moving lifecycle, and cause `GetOutboundRevertId` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so that it use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events, breaking the invariant that tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/keys.go::GetOutboundRevertId
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: values that become identical only after trimming, lowercasing, or address canonicalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `GetOutboundRevertId` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so it can use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events.
- Invariant to test: tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
