# Q2530: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
