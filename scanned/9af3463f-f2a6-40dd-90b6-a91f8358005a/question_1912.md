# Q1912: accrue-user-debts via accrue: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `accrue` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
