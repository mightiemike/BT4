# Q2569: get-full-position via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) — which returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, then read `get-full-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
