# Q3906: calc-utilization via liquidate-multi: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-utilization` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
