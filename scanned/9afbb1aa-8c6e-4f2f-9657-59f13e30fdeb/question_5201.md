# Q5201: accrue-user-debts via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `collateral-receiver`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
