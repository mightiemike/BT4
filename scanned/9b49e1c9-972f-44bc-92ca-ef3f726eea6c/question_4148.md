# Q4148: unwrap-status via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `unwrap-status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111` -> `unwrap-status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `unwrap-status` resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the set of assets held varied, and assert that the value `unwrap-status` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
