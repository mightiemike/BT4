# Q0355: Unprivileged process initiation bypasses admin authority via Tss Key Ids, Process / Gasless Admission Can Make in msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state when gasless admission can make repetition cheap, and cause `msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it start or alter TSS key lifecycle from a non-admin path, breaking the invariant that only the configured authority should initiate key processes or migrations, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can start or alter TSS key lifecycle from a non-admin path.
- Invariant to test: only the configured authority should initiate key processes or migrations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
