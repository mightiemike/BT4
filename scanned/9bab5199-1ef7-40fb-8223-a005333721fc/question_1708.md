# Q1708: Reverse PRC20 lookup resolves the wrong source asset via Chain Ids, Token Addresses, / Same Asset May Appear in VaultMethods.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows when the same asset may appear in multiple encodings or address formats, and cause `VaultMethods.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a user flow that should map one PRC20 back to another source-chain asset, breaking the invariant that one PRC20 address must resolve to exactly one canonical external asset configuration, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/vault_methods.go::VaultMethods.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: chain ids, token addresses, PRC20 addresses, recipients, and assets that are consumed by normal user bridge or payload flows
- Exploit idea: Cause `VaultMethods.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a user flow that should map one PRC20 back to another source-chain asset.
- Invariant to test: one PRC20 address must resolve to exactly one canonical external asset configuration
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
