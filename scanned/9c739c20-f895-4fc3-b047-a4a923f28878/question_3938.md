# Q3938: Legacy compatibility synthesis becomes a public DoS vector via Malformed Nil Requests Sit / Attacker Can Repeat Request in Querier.AllFinalizedBallots

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node with malformed or nil requests that sit on parser edges when the attacker can repeat the request pattern cheaply, and cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it route queries through expensive compatibility code that reconstructs large derived views, breaking the invariant that legacy query support must not let public callers trigger validator-expensive recomputation, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/query_server.go::Querier.AllFinalizedBallots
- Entrypoint: a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node
- Attacker controls: malformed or nil requests that sit on parser edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can route queries through expensive compatibility code that reconstructs large derived views.
- Invariant to test: legacy query support must not let public callers trigger validator-expensive recomputation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a query-server test or benchmark that sends the crafted public request pattern and measure iteration, allocation, and error behavior
