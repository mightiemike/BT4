# Q3370: max_slot_for_pubkey arithmetic overflows on reachable values (accounts_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `max_slot_for_pubkey` in `accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs` with a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested, and make the arithmetic in `max_slot_for_pubkey` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs` -> `max_slot_for_pubkey()` (around line 230)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `max_slot_for_pubkey` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `max_slot_for_pubkey` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
