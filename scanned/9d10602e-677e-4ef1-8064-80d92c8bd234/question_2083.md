# Q2083: calc-multiplier-delta via redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, then read `calc-multiplier-delta` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
