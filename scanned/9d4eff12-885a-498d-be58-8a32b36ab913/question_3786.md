# Q3786: BeginBlocker burned address balance against total supply

## Question
Can unprivileged account influencing balances sent to configured burned addresses enter through `BeginBlocker` by send bond and non-bond denom funds to configured burned addresses before BeginBlocker while controlling funds sent to burned addresses, block height, inflation params, bond denom balances, focusing on decay epoch boundary, under the precondition that the address is configured as burned in production params, then combine burned-address balance changes with inflation decay epoch boundaries, causing `total supply` to diverge so the invariant `non-bond denoms cannot corrupt bond-denom supply or reward accounting` fails and the attacker can burn or mint the wrong denom and corrupt total supply, leading to High inflation or burn accounting flaw that materially misallocates value on-chain?

## Target
- File/function: x/inflation/abci.go::BeginBlocker
- Entrypoint: begin block execution with default-enabled inflation module
- Attacker controls: funds sent to burned addresses, block height, inflation params, bond denom balances
- Exploit idea: burn or mint the wrong denom and corrupt total supply by testing the burned address balance angle against `total supply` during `combine burned-address balance changes with inflation decay epoch boundaries`, with specific focus on decay epoch boundary.
- Invariant to test: non-bond denoms cannot corrupt bond-denom supply or reward accounting; additionally, only intended balances are burned and total supply changes match the burned coins.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High inflation or burn accounting flaw that materially misallocates value on-chain; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test advancing blocks with bank supply and inflation params assertions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
