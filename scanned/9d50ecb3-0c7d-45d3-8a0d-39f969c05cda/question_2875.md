# Q2875: linear-interpolate via accrue: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `accrue` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, then read `linear-interpolate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
