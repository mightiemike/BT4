# Q0062: Outbound identity collision cross-links two payouts via Destination-Chain Observation Fields Such / Destination Observation Drives Refund in Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromReceiptIfOutbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg` when the destination observation drives refund or revert logic, and cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromReceiptIfOutbound` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it make two distinct outbounds share one id so finalization or refunds update the wrong record, breaking the invariant that each outbound id must bind to exactly one destination action and one refund/revert lifecycle, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/create_outbound.go::Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromReceiptIfOutbound
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CreateUniversalTxFromReceiptIfOutbound` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can make two distinct outbounds share one id so finalization or refunds update the wrong record.
- Invariant to test: each outbound id must bind to exactly one destination action and one refund/revert lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
