# Q0618: deposit blob admitted but not executable via `fetch_deposits` (deposit_data_mempool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who submits a deposit blob whose `eth_call` simulation succeeds against current state but not at inclusion height, controlling the `calc_tx_id` preimage, drive `fetch_deposits` in `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` so that the deposit that `eth_call` simulated at admission time and the deposit the Bridge system contract actually executes at inclusion height stop being the same call, breaking the invariant that a deposit accepted into `DepositDataMempool` executes with identical semantics at inclusion?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` -> `fetch_deposits`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party submits a deposit blob whose `eth_call` simulation succeeds against current state but not at inclusion height
- Attacker controls: the `calc_tx_id` preimage
- Exploit idea: deposit blob admitted but not executable - reach `fetch_deposits` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the deposit that `eth_call` simulated at admission time and the deposit the Bridge system contract actually executes at inclusion height stop being the same call; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `DepositDataMempool`, `make_deposit_tx_from_data`, `remove_deposits`, `add_deposit_tx`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: a deposit accepted into `DepositDataMempool` executes with identical semantics at inclusion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft / unauthorized minting of cBTC (bridge deposit accounting broken)
- Fast validation: unit-test the mempool admission path, then apply the same blob one block later and diff the Bridge call outcome
