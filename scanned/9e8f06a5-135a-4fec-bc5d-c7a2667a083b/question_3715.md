# Q3715: Stale process finalization overwrites the active key via User-Created Outbound Flow Eventually / Live Outbounds Migrations Depend in Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state when live outbounds or migrations depend on the evolving TSS record, and cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it cause an old or parallel process to become authoritative after a newer state already exists, breaking the invariant that only the one correct active TSS process should be able to define the active key, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/tss_key_process.go::Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: a user-created outbound flow that eventually depends on TSS state or fund migration state
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.FinalizeTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can cause an old or parallel process to become authoritative after a newer state already exists.
- Invariant to test: only the one correct active TSS process should be able to define the active key
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
