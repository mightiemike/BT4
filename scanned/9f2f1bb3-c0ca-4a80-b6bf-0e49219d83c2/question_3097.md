# Q3097: Wrong chain-meta values distort refund or gas-fee settlement via Cross-Chain Activity Whose Fees / Live User Flows Depend in Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain when live user flows depend on the stored gas-price and chain-height values, and cause `Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows, breaking the invariant that gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows.
- Invariant to test: gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
