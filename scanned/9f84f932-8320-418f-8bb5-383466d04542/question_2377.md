# Q2377: vault-system-repay via borrow: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) — which routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `vault-system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
