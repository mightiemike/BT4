# Q0446: calc-multiplier-delta via borrow: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `borrow` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `calc-multiplier-delta` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
