# Q1803: processEventsAndClaimBonus owner binding against validator event ref counts

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim after tier APY update forces claimRewardsAndUpdateTierPositions, causing `validator event ref counts` to diverge so the invariant `event ref counts cannot be decremented below the number of dependent positions` fails and the attacker can claim bonus for unbonded intervals by persisting incorrect LastKnownBonded, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/claim_rewards.go::Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus
- Entrypoint: ClaimTierRewards and position lifecycle reward claims
- Attacker controls: claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, delegation shares
- Exploit idea: claim bonus for unbonded intervals by persisting incorrect LastKnownBonded by testing the owner binding angle against `validator event ref counts` during `claim after tier APY update forces claimRewardsAndUpdateTierPositions`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: event ref counts cannot be decremented below the number of dependent positions; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: state-machine keeper test with synthetic validator events and reward pool balance checks; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
