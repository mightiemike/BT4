# Q0510: write-feeds via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling call ordering within the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `write-feeds` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
