# Q5275: mask-to-list-internal via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `mask-to-list-internal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
