# Q3061: oracle-timestamp-fresh via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `oracle-timestamp-fresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365) — which sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)` — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365` -> `oracle-timestamp-fresh`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `oracle-timestamp-fresh` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
