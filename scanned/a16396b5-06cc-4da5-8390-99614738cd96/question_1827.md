# Q1827: Domain separation gap cross-links two record families via Cross-Chain Identifiers Are Semantically / One Collision Split Would in Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with cross-chain identifiers that are semantically different but hash to the same derived record if canonicalization is too lenient when one collision or split would affect a value-moving lifecycle, and cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it cause ids from one domain to be usable in another because separation or labeling is incomplete, breaking the invariant that inbound, outbound, rescue, revert, and ballot records must be cryptographically disjoint, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or wrong finalization leading to permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: cross-chain identifiers that are semantically different but hash to the same derived record if canonicalization is too lenient
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can cause ids from one domain to be usable in another because separation or labeling is incomplete.
- Invariant to test: inbound, outbound, rescue, revert, and ballot records must be cryptographically disjoint
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or wrong finalization leading to permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
