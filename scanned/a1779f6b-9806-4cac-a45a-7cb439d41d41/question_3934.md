# Q3934: unpack-u16 via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
