# Q1545: iterate can serve state that disagrees with the cache (consume_worker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `iterate` in `core/src/banking_stage/consume_worker.rs` with a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance, and make the block's declared limits disagree with the work the block's transactions actually require, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/consume_worker.rs` -> `iterate()` (around line 308)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance
- Exploit idea: Make `iterate` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
