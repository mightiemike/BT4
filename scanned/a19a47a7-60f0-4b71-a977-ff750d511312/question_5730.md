# Q5730: delete-then-read semantics via `as_ref` (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who sends an L2 transaction whose execution touches a JMT slot no other transaction touches, controlling which JMT keys are read and written, drive `as_ref` in `crates/sovereign-sdk/module-system/sov-modules-core/src/storage/mod.rs` so that the value observed after a delete in-block and the value the JMT commits stop being consistent, breaking the invariant that deletes are visible identically natively and in-circuit?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sovereign-sdk/module-system/sov-modules-core/src/storage/mod.rs` -> `as_ref`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party sends an L2 transaction whose execution touches a JMT slot no other transaction touches
- Attacker controls: which JMT keys are read and written
- Exploit idea: delete-then-read semantics - reach `as_ref` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the value observed after a delete in-block and the value the JMT commits stop being consistent; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `StorageKey`, `StorageValue`, `StorageProof`, `Storage`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: deletes are visible identically natively and in-circuit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unintended permanent chain split: honest nodes accept a state root the proved chain does not contain
- Fast validation: write/delete/read the same key and diff roots
