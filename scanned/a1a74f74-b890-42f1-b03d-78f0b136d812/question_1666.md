# Q1666: filter-u128 via collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
