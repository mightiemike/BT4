# Q3537: Boundary-case numeric fields pass validation but break later logic via Whitespace, Padding, Casing, Zero-Value / Same Field Is Later in UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later when the same field is later canonicalized or decoded more aggressively, and cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use zero, extreme, or malformed numeric inputs that survive type checks and destabilize execution, breaking the invariant that type-level validation must bound numeric inputs enough to protect later value-moving logic, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or critical chain disruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/universal_account_id.go::UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later
- Exploit idea: Cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use zero, extreme, or malformed numeric inputs that survive type checks and destabilize execution.
- Invariant to test: type-level validation must bound numeric inputs enough to protect later value-moving logic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or critical chain disruption
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
