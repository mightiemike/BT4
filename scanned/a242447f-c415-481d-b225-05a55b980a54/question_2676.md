# Q2676: SendTransfer source sink direction against escrow address

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.SendTransfer` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, focusing on escrow custody, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then send multiple token ids with duplicate or reordered ids in one packet, causing `escrow address` to diverge so the invariant `sender owns every token id before escrow or burn` fails and the attacker can escrow or burn fewer NFTs than the packet claims and mint unbacked vouchers remotely, leading to Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/relay.go::Keeper.SendTransfer
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransfer for nft-transfer
- Attacker controls: SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, Sender, Receiver, timeout height, timeout timestamp
- Exploit idea: escrow or burn fewer NFTs than the packet claims and mint unbacked vouchers remotely by testing the source sink direction angle against `escrow address` during `send multiple token ids with duplicate or reordered ids in one packet`, with specific focus on escrow custody.
- Invariant to test: sender owns every token id before escrow or burn; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: IBC app test over SendTransfer, createOutgoingPacket, OnAcknowledgementPacket, and OnTimeoutPacket; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
