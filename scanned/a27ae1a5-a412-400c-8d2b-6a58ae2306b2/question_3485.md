# Q3485: Fee payer or granter confusion charges the wrong account or no account via Zero-Fee Zero-Gas Transaction Carrying / Nested Messages Expand After in DeductFees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through submission of a Cosmos transaction through the default ante pipeline with a zero-fee or zero-gas transaction carrying a state-changing gasless-adjacent message when nested messages expand after fee classification, and cause `DeductFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it make fee deduction bind to the wrong payer path and let a privileged-flow tx proceed without the intended cost, breaking the invariant that fee deduction must charge the correct authorized payer whenever the tx is not truly gasless, and resulting in Free execution of critical paths leading to chain-wide overload or privilege abuse?

## Target
- File/function: app/ante/fee.go::DeductFees
- Entrypoint: submission of a Cosmos transaction through the default ante pipeline
- Attacker controls: a zero-fee or zero-gas transaction carrying a state-changing gasless-adjacent message
- Exploit idea: Cause `DeductFees` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can make fee deduction bind to the wrong payer path and let a privileged-flow tx proceed without the intended cost.
- Invariant to test: fee deduction must charge the correct authorized payer whenever the tx is not truly gasless
- Expected Immunefi impact: Free execution of critical paths leading to chain-wide overload or privilege abuse
- Fast validation: write a Go ante test that submits the crafted tx repeatedly and verify whether fees, gas checks, and message classification remain aligned
