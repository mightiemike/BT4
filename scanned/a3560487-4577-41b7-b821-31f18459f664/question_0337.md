# Q0337: Bootstrap median can be defined from an attacker-manipulated vote set via Gasless Msgvotechainmeta Submission If / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in Keeper.CalculateGasCost

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `Keeper.CalculateGasCost` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends, breaking the invariant that initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.CalculateGasCost
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.CalculateGasCost` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends.
- Invariant to test: initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
