# Q1594: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
