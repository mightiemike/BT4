# Q2333: Authz wrapping weakens TSS authority checks via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when the attacker does not already control a UV, admin, or governance key, and cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks, breaking the invariant that wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_vote_fund_migration.go::MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks.
- Invariant to test: wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
