# Q2417: parse_cpi_guard_instruction panics on attacker-reachable input (cpi_guard.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `parse_cpi_guard_instruction` in `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/cpi_guard.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `parse_cpi_guard_instruction`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/cpi_guard.rs` -> `parse_cpi_guard_instruction()` (around line 9)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Reach `parse_cpi_guard_instruction` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `parse_cpi_guard_instruction` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
