# Q0569: Lifecycle state confusion makes a non-UV effectively eligible via Direct Msgupdateuniversalvalidator Related Uvalidator / Mutated Identity Would Affect in Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message when the mutated identity would affect live cross-chain flows, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes, breaking the invariant that only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_universal_validator.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes.
- Invariant to test: only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
