# Q4152: next-index via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
