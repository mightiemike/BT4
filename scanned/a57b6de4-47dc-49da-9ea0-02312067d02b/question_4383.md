# Q4383: insert via liquidate-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
