# Q2484: TransferNFT owner binding against collection index

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `msgServer.TransferNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, focusing on IBC-prefixed denom separation, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then transfer from or to an escrow/module address and test later refunds, causing `collection index` to diverge so the invariant `old owner index removes the token exactly when new owner index adds it` fails and the attacker can move an escrowed NFT out of IBC custody and cause later unescrow loss, leading to Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TransferNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransferNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: move an escrowed NFT out of IBC custody and cause later unescrow loss by testing the owner binding angle against `collection index` during `transfer from or to an escrow/module address and test later refunds`, with specific focus on IBC-prefixed denom separation.
- Invariant to test: old owner index removes the token exactly when new owner index adds it; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper/app test asserting owner indexes before and after TransferNFT and IBC send; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
