# Q4323: total-assets via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
