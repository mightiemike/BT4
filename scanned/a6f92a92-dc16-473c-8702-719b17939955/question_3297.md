# Q3297: Unprivileged chain-meta vote sets oracle-controlled fees via Repeated Votes Vote Updates / Chain Will Later Use in ChainMeta.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic when the chain will later use the medianed values to quote or refund gas, and cause `ChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach the vote path without already being an eligible UV and write attacker-chosen oracle inputs, breaking the invariant that only eligible UV votes should be able to influence chain meta and downstream gas accounting, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through wrong gas accounting?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/chain_meta.go::ChainMeta.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic
- Exploit idea: Cause `ChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach the vote path without already being an eligible UV and write attacker-chosen oracle inputs.
- Invariant to test: only eligible UV votes should be able to influence chain meta and downstream gas accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds through wrong gas accounting
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
