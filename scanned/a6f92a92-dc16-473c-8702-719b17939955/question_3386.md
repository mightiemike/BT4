# Q3386: Duplicate vote handling counts one actor twice effectively via Vote-Bearing Messages If Signer / Attacker Can Generate Many in MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once, breaking the invariant that each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator_status.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once.
- Invariant to test: each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
