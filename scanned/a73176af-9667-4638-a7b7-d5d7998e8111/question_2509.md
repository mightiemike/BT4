# Q2509: Vote storage growth or duplicate handling becomes a block-time DoS via Cross-Chain Activity Whose Fees / Vote-Processing Runs In Normal in ChainMeta.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain when vote-processing runs in normal block execution, and cause `ChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth, breaking the invariant that publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/chain_meta.go::ChainMeta.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain
- Exploit idea: Cause `ChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth.
- Invariant to test: publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
