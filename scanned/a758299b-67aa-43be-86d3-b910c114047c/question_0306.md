# Q0306: accrue-user-debts via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
