# Q0893: collateral-add via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) — which evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
