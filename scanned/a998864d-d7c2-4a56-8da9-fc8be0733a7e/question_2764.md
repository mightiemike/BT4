# Q2764: netlink_get_routes confuses account types or owners (netlink.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `netlink_get_routes` in `xdp/src/netlink.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and have `netlink_get_routes` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`netlink_get_routes` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/netlink.rs` -> `netlink_get_routes()` (around line 715)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `netlink_get_routes` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `netlink_get_routes` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `netlink_get_routes` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
