# Q3580: Quorum recompute revives or flips a terminal ballot incorrectly via Observation Variants Differ Only / Variant Handling Is Only in MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when variant handling is the only guard against semantic collisions, and cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result, breaking the invariant that terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_remove_universal_validator.go::MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgRemoveUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result.
- Invariant to test: terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
