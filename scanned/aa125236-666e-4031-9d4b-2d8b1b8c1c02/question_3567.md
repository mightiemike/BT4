# Q3567: debt-preview via deposit: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `deposit` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-preview` touches, run `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
