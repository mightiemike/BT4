# Q0350: load_account_entry_from_disk grows memory without an enforced bound (in_mem_accounts_index.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `load_account_entry_from_disk` in `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/in_mem_accounts_index.rs` with integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates, and grow the buffer `load_account_entry_from_disk` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/in_mem_accounts_index.rs` -> `load_account_entry_from_disk()` (around line 214)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `load_account_entry_from_disk` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply create accounts or writes that force disproportionate storage, index, scan, hashing, or background-cleanup work and exhaust node memory or disk below true transaction cost.
