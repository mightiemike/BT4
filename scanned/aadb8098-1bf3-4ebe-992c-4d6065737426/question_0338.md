# Q0338: principal-ratio-reduction via liquidate-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
