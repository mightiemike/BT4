# Q5913: iter-price-multi via collateral-remove-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), drive `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) — which carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64` — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `iter-price-multi` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
