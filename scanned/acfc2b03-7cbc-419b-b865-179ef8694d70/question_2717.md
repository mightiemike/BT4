# Q2717: multi_target_send confuses account types or owners (sendmmsg.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `multi_target_send` in `streamer/src/sendmmsg.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and have `multi_target_send` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`multi_target_send` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/sendmmsg.rs` -> `multi_target_send()` (around line 227)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `multi_target_send` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `multi_target_send` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `multi_target_send` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
