# Q0176: refresh via supply-collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `refresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
