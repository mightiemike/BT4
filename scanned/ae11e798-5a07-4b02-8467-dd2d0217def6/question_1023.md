# Q1023: Canonicalization collapses safe and unsafe variants into one tally via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Attacker Can Generate Many in MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it change formatting-sensitive fields until honest voters appear to agree on different semantics, breaking the invariant that variant handling must preserve every field that changes execution outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator_status.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidatorStatus.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can change formatting-sensitive fields until honest voters appear to agree on different semantics.
- Invariant to test: variant handling must preserve every field that changes execution outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
