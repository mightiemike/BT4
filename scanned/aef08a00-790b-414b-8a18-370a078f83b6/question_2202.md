# Q2202: status via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `debt-amount` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `status` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
