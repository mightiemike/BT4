# Q3441: iter-lookup-collateral via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) — which skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `iter-lookup-collateral` touches, run `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
