# Q1208: load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions panics on attacker-reachable input (transaction_processor.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` in `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` with a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` -> `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions()` (around line 402)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not
- Exploit idea: Reach `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
