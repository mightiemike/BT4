# Q3632: node_id_to_vote_accounts arithmetic overflows on reachable values (epoch_stakes.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `node_id_to_vote_accounts` in `runtime/src/epoch_stakes.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and make the arithmetic in `node_id_to_vote_accounts` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/epoch_stakes.rs` -> `node_id_to_vote_accounts()` (around line 325)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `node_id_to_vote_accounts` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `node_id_to_vote_accounts` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
