# Q2631: Status transitions allow double refund or double remint via Multiple Outbounds Emitted From / Destination Observation Drives Refund in MsgVoteOutbound.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with multiple outbounds emitted from one payload or receipt when the destination observation drives refund or revert logic, and cause `MsgVoteOutbound.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it move an outbound through observed, reverted, aborted, or refund-applied states more than once, breaking the invariant that each outbound should permit at most one terminal refund or remint outcome, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_outbound.go::MsgVoteOutbound.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: multiple outbounds emitted from one payload or receipt
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteOutbound.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can move an outbound through observed, reverted, aborted, or refund-applied states more than once.
- Invariant to test: each outbound should permit at most one terminal refund or remint outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
