# Q0439: is_parsable is not deterministic across nodes (main.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `is_parsable` in `accounts-db/store-histogram/src/main.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make the lamports summed into capitalization disagree with the lamports stored across account entries, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `is_parsable` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/store-histogram/src/main.rs` -> `is_parsable()` (around line 31)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Find input to `is_parsable` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `is_parsable` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `is_parsable` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
