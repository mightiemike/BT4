# Q3103: Wrong chain-meta values distort refund or gas-fee settlement via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Live User Flows Depend in MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when live user flows depend on the stored gas-price and chain-height values, and cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows, breaking the invariant that gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_chain_meta.go::MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows.
- Invariant to test: gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
