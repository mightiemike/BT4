# Q4467: get-available-assets via transfer: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `transfer` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-available-assets` touches, run `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
