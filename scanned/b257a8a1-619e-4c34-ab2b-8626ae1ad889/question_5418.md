# Q5418: resolve-callcode via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `resolve-callcode` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
