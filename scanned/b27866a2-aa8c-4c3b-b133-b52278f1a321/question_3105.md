# Q3105: relevant via borrow: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) — which drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `borrow` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `relevant` touches, run `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
