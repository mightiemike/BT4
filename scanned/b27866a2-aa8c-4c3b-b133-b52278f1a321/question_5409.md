# Q5409: total-debt via supply-collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index` — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-debt` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
