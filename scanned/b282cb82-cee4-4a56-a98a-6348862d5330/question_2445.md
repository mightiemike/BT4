# Q2445: mask-to-list-collateral via repay: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) — which expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64 — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `repay` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-to-list-collateral` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
