# Q4415: interest-rate via liquidate-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
