# Q2072: deserialize_parameters confuses account types or owners (serialization.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `deserialize_parameters` in `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` with integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates, and have `deserialize_parameters` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`deserialize_parameters` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` -> `deserialize_parameters()` (around line 305)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `deserialize_parameters` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `deserialize_parameters` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `deserialize_parameters` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
