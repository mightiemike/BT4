# Q1116: shared_block_cost charges far less than it costs (cost_tracker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `shared_block_cost` in `cost-model/src/cost_tracker.rs` with a denominator that the attacker can drive to zero or one, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `shared_block_cost` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/cost_tracker.rs` -> `shared_block_cost()` (around line 187)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a denominator that the attacker can drive to zero or one
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `shared_block_cost`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply create accounts or writes that force disproportionate storage, index, scan, hashing, or background-cleanup work and exhaust node memory or disk below true transaction cost.
