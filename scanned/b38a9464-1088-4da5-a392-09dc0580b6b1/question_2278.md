# Q2278: mask-pos via collateral-remove: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
