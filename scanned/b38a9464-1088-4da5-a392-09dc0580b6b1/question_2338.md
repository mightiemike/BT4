# Q2338: mask-to-list-internal via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
