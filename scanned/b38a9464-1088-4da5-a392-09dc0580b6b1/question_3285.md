# Q3285: relevant via liquidate: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) — which drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `liquidate` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `relevant` touches, run `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
