# Q1809: get_slot_leader_at_index confuses account types or owners (vote_keyed.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `get_slot_leader_at_index` in `leader-schedule/src/vote_keyed.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and have `get_slot_leader_at_index` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_slot_leader_at_index` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `leader-schedule/src/vote_keyed.rs` -> `get_slot_leader_at_index()` (around line 147)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_slot_leader_at_index` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_slot_leader_at_index` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_slot_leader_at_index` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
