# Q0165: Unprivileged TSS vote bypasses signer restrictions via Direct Utss Message Submission / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers when the attacker does not already control a UV, admin, or governance key, and cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a gasless TSS vote from an unprivileged account count as though it came from an eligible UV, breaking the invariant that only eligible UVs should be able to advance TSS event or migration ballots, and resulting in Wrong TSS state leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_update_params.go::MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateParams.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a gasless TSS vote from an unprivileged account count as though it came from an eligible UV.
- Invariant to test: only eligible UVs should be able to advance TSS event or migration ballots
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS state leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
