# Q0116: set_startup is not deterministic across nodes (accounts_index_storage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `set_startup` in `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/accounts_index_storage.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and make the stored account meta length disagree with the bytes actually readable from the append vec, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `set_startup` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/accounts_index_storage.rs` -> `set_startup()` (around line 105)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Find input to `set_startup` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `set_startup` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `set_startup` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
