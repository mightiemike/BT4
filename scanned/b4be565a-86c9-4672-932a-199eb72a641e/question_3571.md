# Q3571: send-tokens via repay: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `repay` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, then read `send-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
