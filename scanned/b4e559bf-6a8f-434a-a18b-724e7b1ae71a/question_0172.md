# Q0172: Process or event identity collision cross-links TSS state via Repeated Actions Meant Strand / Attacker Can Create More in GenesisState.Validate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with repeated actions meant to strand pending events or migrations when the attacker can create more than one related flow over time, and cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make two semantically different TSS events share enough identity to update the same record, breaking the invariant that each TSS process and event must have a unique, non-colliding lifecycle, and resulting in Wrong signing state causing direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/genesis.go::GenesisState.Validate
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: repeated actions meant to strand pending events or migrations
- Exploit idea: Cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make two semantically different TSS events share enough identity to update the same record.
- Invariant to test: each TSS process and event must have a unique, non-colliding lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong signing state causing direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
