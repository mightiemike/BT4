# Q0536: Staleness handling pins an old chain height and freezes processing via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / Live User Flows Depend in Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when live user flows depend on the stored gas-price and chain-height values, and cause `Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire, breaking the invariant that stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/fees.go::Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeductGasFeesFromReceipt` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire.
- Invariant to test: stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
