# Q2433: Pending-outbound cleanup makes recovery impossible after partial failure via Destination-Chain Observation Fields Such / Terminal Status Should Be in Keeper.RecordOutboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg` when terminal status should be reached exactly once, and cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it remove the pending index before the outbound has a durable, recoverable terminal state, breaking the invariant that every outbound must remain recoverable until one correct terminal outcome is durably stored, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/pending_outbound.go::Keeper.RecordOutboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can remove the pending index before the outbound has a durable, recoverable terminal state.
- Invariant to test: every outbound must remain recoverable until one correct terminal outcome is durably stored
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
