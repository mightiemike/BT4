# Q2113: Staleness handling pins an old chain height and freezes processing via Cross-Chain Activity Whose Fees / First Write Stale Update in Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire, breaking the invariant that stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/gas_fee.go::Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: cross-chain activity whose fees or refunds depend on chain-meta values written on-chain
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.GetGasFeeInfoForRevertOutbound` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire.
- Invariant to test: stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
