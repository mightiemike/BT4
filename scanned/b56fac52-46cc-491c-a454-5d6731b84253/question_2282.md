# Q2282: Unprivileged token-config update or removal bypasses authority via Chain Token Config Payloads / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account when the attacker does not already control admin or governance keys, and cause `MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it change or remove a live token config from an attacker account, breaking the invariant that live token mappings must not be mutable by unprivileged users, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_update_chain_config.go::MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can change or remove a live token config from an attacker account.
- Invariant to test: live token mappings must not be mutable by unprivileged users
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
