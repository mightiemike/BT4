# Q5480: calc-index-next via supply-collateral-add: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
