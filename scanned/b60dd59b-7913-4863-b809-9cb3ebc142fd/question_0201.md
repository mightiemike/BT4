# Q201: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against distribution withdraw address

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator, causing `distribution withdraw address` to diverge so the invariant `source shares decrease and position shares increase with no token creation or loss` fails and the attacker can transfer fewer source shares than the position receives and mint economic staking value, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: transfer fewer source shares than the position receives and mint economic staking value by testing the owner binding angle against `distribution withdraw address` during `commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: source shares decrease and position shares increase with no token creation or loss; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
