# Q4092: refresh via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
