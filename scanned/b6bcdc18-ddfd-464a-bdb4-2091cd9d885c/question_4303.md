# Q4303: get-position via collateral-remove-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
