# Q5133: calc-index-next via repay: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `repay` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
