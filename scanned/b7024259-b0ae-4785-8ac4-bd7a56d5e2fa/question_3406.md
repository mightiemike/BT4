# Q3406: next-index via accrue: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `accrue` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
