# Q0402: Quorum recompute revives or flips a terminal ballot incorrectly via Observation Variants Differ Only / Honest Uvs Later Vote in msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidatorStatus

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidatorStatus` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result, breaking the invariant that terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidatorStatus
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidatorStatus` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can use validator-set changes and attacker-created observations to move a terminal ballot to a new result.
- Invariant to test: terminal ballot results must remain stable or recompute only under strictly safe rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
