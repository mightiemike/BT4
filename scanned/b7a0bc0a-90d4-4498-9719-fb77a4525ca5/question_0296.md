# Q296: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against position indexes

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator, causing `position indexes` to diverge so the invariant `source shares decrease and position shares increase with no token creation or loss` fails and the attacker can set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: set the position delegator withdraw address to a non-owner and redirect base rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `position indexes` during `commit a delegation immediately after receiving redelegated stake to the target validator`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: source shares decrease and position shares increase with no token creation or loss; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
