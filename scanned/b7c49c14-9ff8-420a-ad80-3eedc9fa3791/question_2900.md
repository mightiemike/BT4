# Q2900: max_concurrent_connections panics on attacker-reachable input (simple_qos.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `max_concurrent_connections` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/simple_qos.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `max_concurrent_connections`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/simple_qos.rs` -> `max_concurrent_connections()` (around line 422)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Reach `max_concurrent_connections` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `max_concurrent_connections` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
