# Q2268: Migration path reaches privileged contract logic without owner authority via Gasless Msgexecutepayload Msgmigrateuea Chosen / Same Signed Intent May in MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData` when the same signed intent may be submitted more than once, and cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it turn migration payload semantics into an unprivileged upgrade or takeover of a UEA, breaking the invariant that migration-capable execution must remain bound to the real owner authorization, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freezing through account takeover?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_migrate_uea.go::MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData`
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgMigrateUEA.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can turn migration payload semantics into an unprivileged upgrade or takeover of a UEA.
- Invariant to test: migration-capable execution must remain bound to the real owner authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freezing through account takeover
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
