# Q3576: oracle-price-legal via collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `oracle-price-legal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
