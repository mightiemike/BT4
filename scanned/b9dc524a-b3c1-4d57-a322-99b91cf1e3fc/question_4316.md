# Q4316: accrue-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
