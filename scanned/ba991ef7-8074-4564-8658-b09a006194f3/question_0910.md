# Q0910: Enabled-flag interpretation strands a live user flow via User-Controlled Inbound Outbound Forces / Registry-Derived Semantics Affect Mint, in Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset when registry-derived semantics affect mint, refund, revert, or outbound routing, and cause `Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so that it make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config, breaking the invariant that enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/keeper.go::Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.GetTokenConfigByPRC20` to return the wrong live object for attacker-controlled identifiers, so it can make a user action pass one enablement gate and later fail under a different interpretation of the same config.
- Invariant to test: enabled flags must produce one consistent allow/deny decision across the full lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
