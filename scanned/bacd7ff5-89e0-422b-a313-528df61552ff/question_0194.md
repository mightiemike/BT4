# Q0194: calc-cumulative-debt via redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption varied, and assert that the value `calc-cumulative-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
