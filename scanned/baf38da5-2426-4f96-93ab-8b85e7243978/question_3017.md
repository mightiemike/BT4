# Q3017: next-index via supply-collateral-add: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, drive `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) — which returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
