# Q0237: add-user-collateral via repay: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) — which adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `repay` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `add-user-collateral` touches, run `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
