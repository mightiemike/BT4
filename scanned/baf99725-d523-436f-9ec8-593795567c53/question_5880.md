# Q5880: merge-price via collateral-remove-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
