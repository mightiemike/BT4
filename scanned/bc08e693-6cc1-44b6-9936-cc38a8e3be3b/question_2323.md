# Q2323: Authz wrapping weakens TSS authority checks via Gasless Tss Vote Messages / Attacker Does Not Already in msgServer.UpdateParams

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with gasless TSS vote messages submitted from an unfunded attacker account when the attacker does not already control a UV, admin, or governance key, and cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks, breaking the invariant that wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.UpdateParams
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: gasless TSS vote messages submitted from an unfunded attacker account
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can reach a TSS mutation or vote through a wrapper path that relaxes intended checks.
- Invariant to test: wrappers must not make TSS state user-mutable without the intended authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
