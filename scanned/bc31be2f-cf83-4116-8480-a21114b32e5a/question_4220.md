# Q4220: collateral-remove via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `collateral-remove` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
