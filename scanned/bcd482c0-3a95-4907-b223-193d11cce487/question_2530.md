# Q2530: Gasless TSS vote admission can be replayed cheaply at scale via Tss Key Ids, Process / Accepted Tss State Would in MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state when accepted TSS state would affect live outbound signing or migration, and cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it use first-use or fee-bypass behavior to repeatedly hit TSS-critical vote paths from an unfunded account, breaking the invariant that TSS vote paths must not become an unprivileged free-spam finalization primitive, and resulting in Inability to finalize or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_vote_fund_migration.go::MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: TSS key ids, process ids, or migration ids chosen to collide with existing state
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteFundMigration.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can use first-use or fee-bypass behavior to repeatedly hit TSS-critical vote paths from an unfunded account.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote paths must not become an unprivileged free-spam finalization primitive
- Expected Immunefi impact: Inability to finalize or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
