# Q4114: interpolate-rate via redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `recipient`, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `recipient`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
