# Q1862: Pre-funded undeployed UEA auto-deploys under the wrong identity via Payload Fields Such As / Target Uea Already Holds in msgServer.VoteChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `msgServer.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it use pre-funding and address derivation edge cases to make auto-deploy claim or execute the wrong account, breaking the invariant that auto-deploy must bind pre-funded value to exactly one intended universal account identity, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can use pre-funding and address derivation edge cases to make auto-deploy claim or execute the wrong account.
- Invariant to test: auto-deploy must bind pre-funded value to exactly one intended universal account identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
