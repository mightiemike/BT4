# Q2508: Vote storage growth or duplicate handling becomes a block-time DoS via Gasless Msgvotechainmeta Submission If / First Write Stale Update in Keeper.PruneValidatorVotes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `Keeper.PruneValidatorVotes` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth, breaking the invariant that publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/gas_price.go::Keeper.PruneValidatorVotes
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` submission if signer restrictions can be bypassed
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.PruneValidatorVotes` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can force repeated chain-meta updates into expensive median computation or storage growth.
- Invariant to test: publicly reachable vote-processing should not let one actor overload validators through duplicate or stale data
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
