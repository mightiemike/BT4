# Q222: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against delegator account

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit near dust/share-rounding boundaries and then compare source and position shares, causing `delegator account` to diverge so the invariant `active incoming redelegation cannot be used to escape slashing by moving stake into a position` fails and the attacker can transfer fewer source shares than the position receives and mint economic staking value, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: transfer fewer source shares than the position receives and mint economic staking value by testing the owner binding angle against `delegator account` during `commit near dust/share-rounding boundaries and then compare source and position shares`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: active incoming redelegation cannot be used to escape slashing by moving stake into a position; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
