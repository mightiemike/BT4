# Q3049: population via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) — which counts set bits to order the bucket search — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, then read `population` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
