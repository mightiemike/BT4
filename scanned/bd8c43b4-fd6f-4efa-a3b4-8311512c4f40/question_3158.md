# Q3158: price-resolve via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `price-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373` -> `price-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `price-resolve` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
