# Q2810: get-account-scaled-debt via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `get-account-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
