# Q1472: send-tokens via transfer: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `transfer` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
