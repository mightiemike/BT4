# Q1091: population via collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) counts set bits to order the bucket search. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing call ordering within the block, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with call ordering within the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
