# Q2233: interest-rate via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
