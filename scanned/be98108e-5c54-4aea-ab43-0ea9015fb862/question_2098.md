# Q2098: write-feed via liquidate-redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the borrower targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
