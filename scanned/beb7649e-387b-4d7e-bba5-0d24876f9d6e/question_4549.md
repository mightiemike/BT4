# Q4549: receive-underlying via deposit: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, drive `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) — which pulls the underlying from a named account — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, then read `receive-underlying` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
