# Q1838: block_revenue_collector can be driven into unbounded work (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `block_revenue_collector` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority, and make `block_revenue_collector` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `block_revenue_collector` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `block_revenue_collector()` (around line 93)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `block_revenue_collector` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `block_revenue_collector` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `block_revenue_collector` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
