# Q1952: prior_voters_offset is not deterministic across nodes (frame_v3.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `prior_voters_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v3.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the rent-exempt minimum enforced on write disagree with the account size actually written, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `prior_voters_offset` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v3.rs` -> `prior_voters_offset()` (around line 85)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `prior_voters_offset` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `prior_voters_offset` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `prior_voters_offset` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
