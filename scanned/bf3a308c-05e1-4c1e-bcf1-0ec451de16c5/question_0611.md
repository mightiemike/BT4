# Q611: AddToTierPosition owner binding against delegation shares

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.AddToTierPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then add funds while validator events are pending and compare rewards before and after setPosition, causing `delegation shares` to diverge so the invariant `owner funds move into the position delegator exactly once before delegation` fails and the attacker can round added amount into excess delegation shares and later withdraw more than deposited, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.AddToTierPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgAddToTierPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, Amount, position exit state, validator exchange rate
- Exploit idea: round added amount into excess delegation shares and later withdraw more than deposited by testing the owner binding angle against `delegation shares` during `add funds while validator events are pending and compare rewards before and after setPosition`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: owner funds move into the position delegator exactly once before delegation; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over AddToTierPosition, claimRewards, delegate, and position state conversion; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
