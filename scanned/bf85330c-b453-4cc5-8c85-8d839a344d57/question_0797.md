# Q0797: Expire/finalize index cleanup leaves a ballot processable twice via Multiple Attacker-Created Observations Honest / Honest Uvs Later Vote in Keeper.UpdateParams

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `Keeper.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it strand ids across active, expired, and finalized sets so later logic acts on them again, breaking the invariant that one ballot must have exactly one terminal lifecycle across all indexes, and resulting in Duplicate or blocked finalization leading to fund loss or freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_params.go::Keeper.UpdateParams
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: multiple attacker-created observations that honest UVs later vote on
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateParams` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can strand ids across active, expired, and finalized sets so later logic acts on them again.
- Invariant to test: one ballot must have exactly one terminal lifecycle across all indexes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Duplicate or blocked finalization leading to fund loss or freeze
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
