# Q2358: accrue-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
