# Q5254: normalize via call-ststx-ratio: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `normalize` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576` -> `normalize`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
