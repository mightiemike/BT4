# Q1310: write-feed via collateral-remove: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `write-feed` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
