# Q5719: remove-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `remove-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
