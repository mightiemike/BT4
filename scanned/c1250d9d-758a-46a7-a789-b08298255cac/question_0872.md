# Q0872: Payload execution emits outbounds under the wrong ownership context via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Same Signed Intent May in Keeper.MigrateUEA

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the same signed intent may be submitted more than once, and cause `Keeper.MigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make outbound-producing execution run as though it belonged to a different user or UTX, breaking the invariant that outbound creation must remain bound to the exact authorized payload and account context, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_migrate_uea.go::Keeper.MigrateUEA
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.MigrateUEA` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make outbound-producing execution run as though it belonged to a different user or UTX.
- Invariant to test: outbound creation must remain bound to the exact authorized payload and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of bridged funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
