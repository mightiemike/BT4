# Q4958: calc-treasury-lp-preview via supply-collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to varied, and assert that the value `calc-treasury-lp-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
