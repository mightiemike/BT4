# Q5356: get-cached-indexes via collateral-remove-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
