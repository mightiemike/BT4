# Q1649: Signer-owner mismatch executes a victim UEA action via Pre-Funded But Undeployed Uea / Payload Can Emit Receipt in Keeper.buildRevertOutbound

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields when the payload can emit receipt logs that create outbounds or rescues, and cause `Keeper.buildRevertOutbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so that it bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address, breaking the invariant that only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/build_revert_outbound.go::Keeper.buildRevertOutbound
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a pre-funded but undeployed UEA address derived from attacker-chosen universal-account fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.buildRevertOutbound` to drive recovery logic into the wrong recipient, asset, or terminal status, so it can bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address.
- Invariant to test: only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
