# Q2420: Cross-chain tx-hash canonicalization merges unrelated events via Fields Feed Directly Into / Different Observers May Supply in Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys when different observers may supply formatting variants of the same logical event, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events, breaking the invariant that tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalTx` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can use a non-EVM or loosely canonicalized hash format to collide two source events.
- Invariant to test: tx-hash canonicalization must stay injective for every supported chain namespace
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
