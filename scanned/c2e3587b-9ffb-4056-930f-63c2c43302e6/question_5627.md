# Q5627: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-underlying`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
