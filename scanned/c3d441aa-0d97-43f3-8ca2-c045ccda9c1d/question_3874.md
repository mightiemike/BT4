# Q3874: spare_capacity_mut can serve state that disagrees with the cache (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `spare_capacity_mut` in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/mod.rs` with a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested, and make the epoch boundary state computed by this node disagree with the state computed by a node that replayed the same blocks, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/mod.rs` -> `spare_capacity_mut()` (around line 95)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested
- Exploit idea: Make `spare_capacity_mut` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
