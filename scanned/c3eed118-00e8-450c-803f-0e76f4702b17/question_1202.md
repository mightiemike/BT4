# Q1202: resolve-or-create via transfer: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `transfer` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
