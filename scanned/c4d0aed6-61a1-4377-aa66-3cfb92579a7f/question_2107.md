# Q2107: Staleness handling pins an old chain height and freezes processing via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / First Write Stale Update in Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire, breaking the invariant that stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.MigrateGasPricesToChainMeta` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can use vote timing or duplicate updates so stale values keep winning after they should expire.
- Invariant to test: stale or future-skewed votes must not preserve a wrong chain height that blocks normal outbound/refund flow
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
