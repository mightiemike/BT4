# Q4967: fee vault accounting via `signed_system_transaction` (system_events.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA, controlling the target system-contract address and selector, drive `signed_system_transaction` in `crates/evm/src/evm/system_events.rs` so that the value deducted from the sender and the value credited to the base-fee/L1-fee/priority-fee vaults stop being equal, breaking the invariant that fees are conserved between payer and vaults?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/evm/src/evm/system_events.rs` -> `signed_system_transaction`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls a Citrea system contract (`BitcoinLightClient`, `BridgeWrapper`, `WCBTC`) from an ordinary EOA
- Attacker controls: the target system-contract address and selector
- Exploit idea: fee vault accounting - reach `signed_system_transaction` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the value deducted from the sender and the value credited to the base-fee/L1-fee/priority-fee vaults stop being equal; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `SystemEvent`, `system_event_to_transaction`, `create_system_transactions`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: fees are conserved between payer and vaults
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user or vault funds
- Fast validation: sum vault deltas against sender deltas over an adversarial block
