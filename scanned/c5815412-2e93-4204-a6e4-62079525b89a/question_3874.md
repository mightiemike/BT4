# Q3874: resolve-pyth via liquidate: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `liquidate` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
