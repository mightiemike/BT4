# Q3429: get-egroup via repay: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, drive `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) — which resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `repay` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-egroup` touches, run `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
