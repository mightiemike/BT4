# Q3094: Wrong chain-meta values distort refund or gas-fee settlement via Repeated Votes Vote Updates / Chain Will Later Use in Keeper.VoteChainMeta

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic when the chain will later use the medianed values to quote or refund gas, and cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows, breaking the invariant that gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/chain_meta.go::Keeper.VoteChainMeta
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteChainMeta` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can push fees or gas-price inputs that make later refund math materially wrong for honest user flows.
- Invariant to test: gas-price oracle values must not let one actor extract value from refund or fee settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
