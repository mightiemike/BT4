# Q1880: increment via repay: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
