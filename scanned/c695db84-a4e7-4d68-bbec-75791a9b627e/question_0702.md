# Q0702: mask-to-list-internal via borrow: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `borrow` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-internal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
