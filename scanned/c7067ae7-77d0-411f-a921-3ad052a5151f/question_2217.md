# Q2217: Invalid inbound still creates a visible UTX but misroutes recovery via Source-Chain Fields Such As / Honest Uvs Later Finalize in Inbound.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload` when honest UVs later finalize whatever canonical observation wins, and cause `Inbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state, breaking the invariant that failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/inbound.go::Inbound.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: source-chain fields such as `tx_hash`, `log_index`, `sender`, `asset_addr`, `amount`, and `raw_payload`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Inbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state.
- Invariant to test: failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
