# Q2822: resolve-interpolation-points via collateral-remove-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `resolve-interpolation-points` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
