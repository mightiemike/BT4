# Q1079: debt-add-scaled via transfer: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `transfer` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
