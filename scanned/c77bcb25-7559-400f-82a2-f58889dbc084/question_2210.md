# Q2210: get-notional-evaluation via borrow: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `borrow` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `get-notional-evaluation` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
