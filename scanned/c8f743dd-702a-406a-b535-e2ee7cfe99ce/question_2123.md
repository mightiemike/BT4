# Q2123: Recipient normalization zeroes or rewrites a meaningful target via Payload Fields Large Enough / Honest Uvs Agree On in DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization when honest UVs agree on the source event but the chain derives the payload itself, and cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it turn a payload-carrying inbound into execution against the wrong recipient or no recipient, breaking the invariant that normalization must not erase or misroute a recipient that affects value movement, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/gateway_pc_event_decode.go::DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields large enough to stress decoding or normalization
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalTxOutboundFromLog` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can turn a payload-carrying inbound into execution against the wrong recipient or no recipient.
- Invariant to test: normalization must not erase or misroute a recipient that affects value movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent lock of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
