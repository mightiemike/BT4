# Q3464: get-cached-indexes via collateral-remove: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `get-cached-indexes` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
