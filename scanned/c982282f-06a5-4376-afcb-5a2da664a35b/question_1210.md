# Q1210: next-liquidity-index via redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `amount` of shares burned, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
