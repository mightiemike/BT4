# Q2079: normalize-pyth via collateral-remove-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `normalize-pyth` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
