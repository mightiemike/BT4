# Q4575: find-collateral-amount via borrow: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `amount`, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `borrow` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-collateral-amount` touches, run `borrow` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
