# Q2542: Cross-chain identity update breaks TSS or outbound recipient assumptions via Address Key Material Validate / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities when the attacker does not already control a privileged UV or admin role, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it change a UV record in a way that downstream modules trust too broadly, breaking the invariant that identity updates must not silently rebind critical offchain or outbound-control semantics, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: address and key material that validate loosely but map to different downstream identities
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can change a UV record in a way that downstream modules trust too broadly.
- Invariant to test: identity updates must not silently rebind critical offchain or outbound-control semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
