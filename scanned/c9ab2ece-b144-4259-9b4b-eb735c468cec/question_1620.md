# Q1620: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against validator tokens

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on reward checkpoint monotonicity, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator, causing `validator tokens` to diverge so the invariant `incoming redelegation cannot be moved into the position to evade slash liability` fails and the attacker can create tiny positions with rewards or voting power despite zero economic value, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: create tiny positions with rewards or voting power despite zero economic value by testing the owner binding angle against `validator tokens` during `commit from a delegation that has a receiving redelegation into the same validator`, with specific focus on reward checkpoint monotonicity.
- Invariant to test: incoming redelegation cannot be moved into the position to evade slash liability; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
