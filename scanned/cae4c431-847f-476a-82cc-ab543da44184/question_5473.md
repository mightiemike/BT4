# Q5473: unpack-u16 via accrue: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) — which unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `accrue` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, then read `unpack-u16` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
