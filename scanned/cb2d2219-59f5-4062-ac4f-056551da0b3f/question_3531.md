# Q3531: calculate_vec_capacity breaks lamport conservation (merkle_tree.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `calculate_vec_capacity` in `merkle-tree/src/merkle_tree.rs` with amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates, and make the lamports `calculate_vec_capacity` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `merkle-tree/src/merkle_tree.rs` -> `calculate_vec_capacity()` (around line 89)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates
- Exploit idea: Drive `calculate_vec_capacity` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `calculate_vec_capacity`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
