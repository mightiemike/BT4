# Q2178: Eligible-voter snapshot drifts away from the observation lifecycle via Sequence Of Deposits Outbounds / Variant Handling Is Only in StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed when variant handling is the only guard against semantic collisions, and cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation, breaking the invariant that ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set, and resulting in Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/staking_hooks.go::StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: a sequence of deposits or outbounds meant to keep ballots pending, expired, or recomputed
- Exploit idea: Cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation.
- Invariant to test: ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
