# Q0735: next-liquidity-index via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
