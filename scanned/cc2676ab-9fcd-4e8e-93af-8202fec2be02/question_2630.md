# Q2630: resolve-dia via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `resolve-dia` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
