# Q0299: resolve-ztoken via borrow: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
`resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `borrow` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
