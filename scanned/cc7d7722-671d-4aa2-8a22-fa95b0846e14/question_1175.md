# Q1175: set_slot_history lets attacker data change the committed hash (account_overrides.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `set_slot_history` in `svm/src/account_overrides.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make the nonce account state used for replay protection disagree with the nonce state written back on rollback, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_overrides.rs` -> `set_slot_history()` (around line 26)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `set_slot_history` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
