# Q0775: Address or owner validation uses the wrong namespace assumptions via Whitespace, Padding, Casing, Zero-Value / Same Field Is Later in MigrationPayload.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later when the same field is later canonicalized or decoded more aggressively, and cause `MigrationPayload.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another, breaking the invariant that address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/migration_payload.go::MigrationPayload.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later
- Exploit idea: Cause `MigrationPayload.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another.
- Invariant to test: address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
