# Q0905: into_address_loader_error can be driven into unbounded work (address_lookup_table.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `into_address_loader_error` in `runtime/src/bank/address_lookup_table.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and make `into_address_loader_error` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `into_address_loader_error` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/address_lookup_table.rs` -> `into_address_loader_error()` (around line 13)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `into_address_loader_error` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `into_address_loader_error` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `into_address_loader_error` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can trigger a panic, unwrap, assertion, index corruption, or unrecoverable I/O error inside AccountsDB, the bucket map, or snapshot handling and halt validators.
