# Q3601: ValidateMsgTransferDecorator.AnteHandle wrapped messages against transaction authorization

## Question
Can unprivileged transaction signer or authz/feegrant grantee enter through `ValidateMsgTransferDecorator.AnteHandle` by submit value-moving messages directly and inside authz or feegrant transactions while controlling message set, MsgTransfer fields, signer, feegrant/authz wrapping, focusing on feegrant payer versus message signer, under the precondition that the wrapped transaction is otherwise valid and signed, then wrap messages in authz exec and test whether decorator inspects nested transfer messages, causing `transaction authorization` to diverge so the invariant `ante validation cannot be bypassed for enabled value-moving transfer messages` fails and the attacker can spend from an unintended account through feegrant/signer mismatch, leading to High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path spending, locking, burning, transferring, or delegating assets contrary to signer intent?

## Target
- File/function: app/ante.go::ValidateMsgTransferDecorator.AnteHandle
- Entrypoint: ante handler for signed Cosmos SDK transactions
- Attacker controls: message set, MsgTransfer fields, signer, feegrant/authz wrapping, transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: spend from an unintended account through feegrant/signer mismatch by testing the wrapped messages angle against `transaction authorization` during `wrap messages in authz exec and test whether decorator inspects nested transfer messages`, with specific focus on feegrant payer versus message signer.
- Invariant to test: ante validation cannot be bypassed for enabled value-moving transfer messages; additionally, ante validation cannot be bypassed by message wrapping.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path spending, locking, burning, transferring, or delegating assets contrary to signer intent; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app ante integration test with signed, authz, feegrant, and multi-message transactions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
