# Q790: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against future withdraw eligibility

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then trigger exit at a boundary timestamp, clear it, trigger again, then withdraw, causing `future withdraw eligibility` to diverge so the invariant `exit state cannot be shortened, replayed, or cleared to bypass economic locks` fails and the attacker can clear and retrigger exit to confuse reward accounting and double claim, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: clear and retrigger exit to confuse reward accounting and double claim by testing the owner binding angle against `future withdraw eligibility` during `trigger exit at a boundary timestamp, clear it, trigger again, then withdraw`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: exit state cannot be shortened, replayed, or cleared to bypass economic locks; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
