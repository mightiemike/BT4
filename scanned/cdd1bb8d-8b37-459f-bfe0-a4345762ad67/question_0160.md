# Q0160: send-underlying via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
