# Q5605: debt-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, drive `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index — to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, then read `debt-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
