# Q0857: socialize-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `socialize-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879) — which calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879` -> `socialize-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
