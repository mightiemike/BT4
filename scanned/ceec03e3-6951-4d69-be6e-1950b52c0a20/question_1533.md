# Q1533: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against redelegation status

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit repeatedly from the same source delegation into multiple positions, causing `redelegation status` to diverge so the invariant `zero or dust transfers cannot create a position with economic rights` fails and the attacker can mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: mint extra shares through Unbond then Delegate exchange-rate mismatch by testing the owner binding angle against `redelegation status` during `commit repeatedly from the same source delegation into multiple positions`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: zero or dust transfers cannot create a position with economic rights; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
