# Q0372: Identity validation accepts attacker-controlled key material with victim semantics via State Transitions Around Join/Leave/Tombstone / Attacker Does Not Already in Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe when the attacker does not already control a privileged UV or admin role, and cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it supply network or public-key data that validates but later routes cross-chain actions to the attacker, breaking the invariant that UV identity fields must uniquely bind downstream offchain or cross-chain identity, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_update_universal_validator.go::Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can supply network or public-key data that validates but later routes cross-chain actions to the attacker.
- Invariant to test: UV identity fields must uniquely bind downstream offchain or cross-chain identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
