# Q3113: TSS vote validation accepts semantically impossible combinations via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Attacker Does Not Already in msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when the attacker does not already control a UV, admin, or governance key, and cause `msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step, breaking the invariant that TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying, and resulting in Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
