# Q3267: Unprivileged chain-config creation bypasses authority via Direct Submission Of Admin- / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message when the attacker does not already control admin or governance keys, and cause `MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make an admin-gated registry write succeed from an unprivileged account, breaking the invariant that only the configured registry authority should mutate chain configuration, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds by malicious reconfiguration?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/msg_update_chain_config.go::MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: a direct submission of an admin- or gov-gated `uregistry` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateChainConfig.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make an admin-gated registry write succeed from an unprivileged account.
- Invariant to test: only the configured registry authority should mutate chain configuration
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds by malicious reconfiguration
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
