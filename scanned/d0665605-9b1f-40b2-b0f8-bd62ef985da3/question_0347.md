# Q0347: Hex emptiness or padding collapses distinct payloads via Hex Blobs Ambiguous Emptiness, / Resulting Payload Can Move in DecodeUniversalPayloadEVM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics when the resulting payload can move value or spawn an outbound, and cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadEVM` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so that it abuse empty, zero-padded, or mixed-case payload blobs that normalize differently across paths, breaking the invariant that distinct payloads must not collapse into one executed authorization intent, and resulting in Unauthorized execution or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/decode_payload.go::DecodeUniversalPayloadEVM
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: hex blobs with ambiguous emptiness, padding, or casing semantics
- Exploit idea: Cause `DecodeUniversalPayloadEVM` to decode bytes into a different semantic object than honest observers or callers expect, so it can abuse empty, zero-padded, or mixed-case payload blobs that normalize differently across paths.
- Invariant to test: distinct payloads must not collapse into one executed authorization intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized execution or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a decoder/keeper test that feeds the crafted raw payload through finalization and compare the executed payload with the source-chain intent
