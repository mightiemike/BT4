# Q5438: increment via liquidate-multi: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `increment` advances the user-id nonce, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
