# Q4077: insert via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) — which rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
