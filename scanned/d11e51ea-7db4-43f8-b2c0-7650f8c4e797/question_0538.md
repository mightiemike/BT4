# Q0538: find-debt-scaled via supply-collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
