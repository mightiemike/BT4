# Q0883: collect_accounts_for_successful_tx breaks lamport conservation (account_saver.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `collect_accounts_for_successful_tx` in `runtime/src/account_saver.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and make the lamports `collect_accounts_for_successful_tx` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/account_saver.rs` -> `collect_accounts_for_successful_tx()` (around line 109)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Drive `collect_accounts_for_successful_tx` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `collect_accounts_for_successful_tx`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
