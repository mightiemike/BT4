# Q4700: mask-to-list-iter via collateral-remove-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-iter` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
