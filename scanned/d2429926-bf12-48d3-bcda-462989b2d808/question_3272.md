# Q3272: remove-user-collateral via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the future mask produced by the new debt bit varied, and assert that the value `remove-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
