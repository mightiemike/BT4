# Q4412: convert-to-assets-preview via transfer: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `transfer` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-assets-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
