# Q0687: Migration path reaches privileged contract logic without owner authority via Payload Fields Such As / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in MigrateUniversalTx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `MigrateUniversalTx` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it turn migration payload semantics into an unprivileged upgrade or takeover of a UEA, breaking the invariant that migration-capable execution must remain bound to the real owner authorization, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freezing through account takeover?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/migrations/v4/migrate.go::MigrateUniversalTx
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `MigrateUniversalTx` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can turn migration payload semantics into an unprivileged upgrade or takeover of a UEA.
- Invariant to test: migration-capable execution must remain bound to the real owner authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or permanent freezing through account takeover
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
