# Q2725: Unprivileged params update rotates TSS control via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Message Is Directly Reachable in MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when the message is directly reachable over normal transaction submission, and cause `MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it change admin-like TSS params without already controlling governance, breaking the invariant that TSS control parameters must remain governance-bound only, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_update_params.go::MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can change admin-like TSS params without already controlling governance.
- Invariant to test: TSS control parameters must remain governance-bound only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
