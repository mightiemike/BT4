# Q5203: create via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, then read `create` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
