# Q5343: price-multi-resolve via liquidate-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `price-multi-resolve` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
