# Q1420: interest-rate via deposit: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `deposit` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
