# Q5859: oracle-last-update via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing `amount`, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-last-update` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
