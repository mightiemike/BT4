# Q0745: calc-cumulative-debt via supply-collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, drive `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) — which multiplies scaled principal by an index — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, then read `calc-cumulative-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
