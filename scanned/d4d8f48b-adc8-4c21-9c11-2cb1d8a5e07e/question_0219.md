# Q0219: resolve-ststx via borrow: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `borrow` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-ststx` touches, run `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
