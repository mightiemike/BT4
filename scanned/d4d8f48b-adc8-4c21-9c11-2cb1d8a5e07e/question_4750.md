# Q4750: linear-interpolate via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
