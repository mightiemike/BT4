# Q2683: create via supply-collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
`create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, use that to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, then read `create` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
