# Q5232: find-asset via liquidate-multi: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `find-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
