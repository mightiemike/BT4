# Q5928: calc-index-next via collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls call ordering within the block reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
