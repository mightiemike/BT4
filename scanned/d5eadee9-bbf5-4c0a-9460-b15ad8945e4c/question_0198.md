# Q0198: interpolate-rate via redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `recipient`, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `recipient` across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
