# Q3356: Duplicate vote handling counts one actor twice effectively via Observation Variants Differ Only / Attacker Can Generate Many in msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidator

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once, breaking the invariant that each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidator
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `msgServer.UpdateUniversalValidator` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can use replay, recompute, or variant handling so one logical voter influences the tally more than once.
- Invariant to test: each eligible voter should count at most once per ballot outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to fund loss or freezes
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
