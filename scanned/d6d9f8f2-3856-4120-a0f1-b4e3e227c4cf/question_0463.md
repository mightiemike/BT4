# Q0463: Refund accounting overpays through gas-fee parsing mismatch via Outbound Whose Revert Instructions, / Destination Observation Drives Refund in Keeper.RecordOutboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action when the destination observation drives refund or revert logic, and cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it supply or induce gas-fee values that make the refund path calculate excess gas incorrectly, breaking the invariant that refunds must never exceed the real unused gas value attributable to that outbound, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/pending_outbound.go::Keeper.RecordOutboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can supply or induce gas-fee values that make the refund path calculate excess gas incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: refunds must never exceed the real unused gas value attributable to that outbound
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
