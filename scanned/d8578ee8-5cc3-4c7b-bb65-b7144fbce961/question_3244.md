# Q3244: calc-cumulative-debt via accrue: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it multiplies scaled principal by an index, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `accrue` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
