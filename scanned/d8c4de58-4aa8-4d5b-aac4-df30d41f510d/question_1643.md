# Q1643: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
