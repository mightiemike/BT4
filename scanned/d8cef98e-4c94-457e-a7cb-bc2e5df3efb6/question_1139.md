# Q1139: send-underlying via supply-collateral-add: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
