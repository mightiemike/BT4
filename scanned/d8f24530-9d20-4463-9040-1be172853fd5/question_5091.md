# Q5091: get-position via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-position` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
