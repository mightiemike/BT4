# Q2785: receive-tokens via borrow: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) — which pulls an asset from a named account — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `borrow` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `receive-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
