# Q5274: get-cached-indexes via liquidate-redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `get-cached-indexes` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
