# Q0974: resolve-ztoken via call-ststx-ratio: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `resolve-ztoken` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
