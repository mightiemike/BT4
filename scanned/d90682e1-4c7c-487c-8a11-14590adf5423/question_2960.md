# Q2960: accrue-user-collateral via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
