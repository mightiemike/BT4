# Q1587: Ballot identity collision merges distinct observations via Vote-Bearing Messages If Signer / Attacker Can Generate Many in StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account when the attacker can generate many such observations through normal use, and cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id, breaking the invariant that one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning, and resulting in Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/staking_hooks.go::StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `StakingHooks.AfterValidatorCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can make two semantically different observations land on one ballot id.
- Invariant to test: one ballot id must correspond to exactly one security-relevant observation meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
