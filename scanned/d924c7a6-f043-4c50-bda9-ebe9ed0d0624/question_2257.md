# Q2257: MintNFT owner binding against denom owner

## Question
Can denom owner or authz grantee enter through `msgServer.MintNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, focusing on token owner authority, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then mint under an IBC-prefixed denom and send through nft-transfer, causing `denom owner` to diverge so the invariant `authz/feegrant cannot widen mint authority beyond the denom owner` fails and the attacker can mint an NFT in someone else's denom and transfer or bridge it as valuable collateral, leading to Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.MintNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgMintNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, Name, URI, Data
- Exploit idea: mint an NFT in someone else's denom and transfer or bridge it as valuable collateral by testing the owner binding angle against `denom owner` during `mint under an IBC-prefixed denom and send through nft-transfer`, with specific focus on token owner authority.
- Invariant to test: authz/feegrant cannot widen mint authority beyond the denom owner; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over MintNFT, collection indexes, owner indexes, and authz signer path; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
