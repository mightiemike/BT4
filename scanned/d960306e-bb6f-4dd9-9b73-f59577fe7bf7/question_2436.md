# Q2436: Pending-outbound cleanup makes recovery impossible after partial failure via Cross-Chain Flow Makes Push / One Payload May Emit in OutboundTx.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with a cross-chain flow that makes Push Chain create one or more outbounds when one payload may emit several outbounds or rescues, and cause `OutboundTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it remove the pending index before the outbound has a durable, recoverable terminal state, breaking the invariant that every outbound must remain recoverable until one correct terminal outcome is durably stored, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/outbound_tx.go::OutboundTx.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: a cross-chain flow that makes Push Chain create one or more outbounds
- Exploit idea: Cause `OutboundTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can remove the pending index before the outbound has a durable, recoverable terminal state.
- Invariant to test: every outbound must remain recoverable until one correct terminal outcome is durably stored
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
