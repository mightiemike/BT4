# Q2870: mask-to-list-iter via repay: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `repay` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-iter` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
