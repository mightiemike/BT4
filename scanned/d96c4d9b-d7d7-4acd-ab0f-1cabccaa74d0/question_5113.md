# Q5113: merge-price via liquidate: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) — which attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `merge-price` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
