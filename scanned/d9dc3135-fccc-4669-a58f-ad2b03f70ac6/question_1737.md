# Q1737: Unprivileged TSS vote bypasses signer restrictions via Signer Fields, Authz Wrapping, / Gasless Admission Can Make in Keeper.VoteTssKeyProcess

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail when gasless admission can make repetition cheap, and cause `Keeper.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it make a gasless TSS vote from an unprivileged account count as though it came from an eligible UV, breaking the invariant that only eligible UVs should be able to advance TSS event or migration ballots, and resulting in Wrong TSS state leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/msg_vote_tss_key_process.go::Keeper.VoteTssKeyProcess
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: signer fields, authz wrapping, or message ids that would matter if authority checks fail
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteTssKeyProcess` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can make a gasless TSS vote from an unprivileged account count as though it came from an eligible UV.
- Invariant to test: only eligible UVs should be able to advance TSS event or migration ballots
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS state leading to direct loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
