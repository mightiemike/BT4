# Q1068: Gas deduction rollback boundary leaves execution without correct charge via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in Keeper.ExecutePayload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `Keeper.ExecutePayload` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails, breaking the invariant that either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/msg_execute_payload.go::Keeper.ExecutePayload
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.ExecutePayload` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can retain a stateful payload effect while gas deduction or receipt handling fails.
- Invariant to test: either the whole payload path reverts, or fees and state must remain internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or critical execution corruption
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
