# Q5616: get-position via liquidate-redeem: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `get-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
