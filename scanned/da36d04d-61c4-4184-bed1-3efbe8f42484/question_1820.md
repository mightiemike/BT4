# Q1820: get-egroup via supply-collateral-add: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `get-egroup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
