# Q1446: Rescue or revert attachment lands on the wrong UTX via Destination-Chain Observation Fields Such / Terminal Status Should Be in Keeper.applyGasRefund

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg` when terminal status should be reached exactly once, and cause `Keeper.applyGasRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it make receipt-derived rescue or revert logic attach to a different transaction record, breaking the invariant that receipt-derived outbounds must stay bound to the exact originating UTX and PC tx, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/outbound.go::Keeper.applyGasRefund
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.applyGasRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can make receipt-derived rescue or revert logic attach to a different transaction record.
- Invariant to test: receipt-derived outbounds must stay bound to the exact originating UTX and PC tx
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
