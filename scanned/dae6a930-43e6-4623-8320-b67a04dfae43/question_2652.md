# Q2652: calc-multiplier-delta via collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `calc-multiplier-delta` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
