# Q3789: Invalid inbound still creates a visible UTX but misroutes recovery via Two Logically Distinct Inbounds / Failed Inbound Should Still in Keeper.RecordInboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound` with two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting when a failed inbound should still preserve a safe recovery path, and cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state, breaking the invariant that failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/inbound.go::Keeper.RecordInboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled source-chain gateway event that honest UVs later submit via `MsgVoteInbound`
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct inbounds that differ only by canonicalization-relevant formatting
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordInboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can drive the post-finalization validation-failure path into a wrong revert or failed-recovery state.
- Invariant to test: failed inbounds must preserve a correct and unique recovery path for user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-party refund
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted inbound(s) through the honest-UV path and inspect the UTX, PC tx, and recovery lifecycle
