# Q2558: zip via repay: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `repay` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `zip` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
