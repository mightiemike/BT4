# Q2631: accessor key derivation via `exists` (accessors.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who inscribes a `DataOnDa::Chunk` blob from an unknown key (no sender check exists on that path), controlling chunk wtxids and their contents, drive `exists` in `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/accessors.rs` so that the storage key an accessor derives for an index and the key another role derives stop being the same, breaking the invariant that accessor keys are single-sourced and collision-free?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/light-client-prover/src/circuit/accessors.rs` -> `exists`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party inscribes a `DataOnDa::Chunk` blob from an unknown key (no sender check exists on that path)
- Attacker controls: chunk wtxids and their contents
- Exploit idea: accessor key derivation - reach `exists` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the storage key an accessor derives for an index and the key another role derives stop being the same; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `BlockHashAccessor`, `ChunkAccessor`, `SequencerCommitmentAccessor`, `VerifiedStateTransitionForSequencerCommitmentIndexAccessor`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: accessor keys are single-sourced and collision-free
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - light client proof split: two honest provers commit different outputs for the same L1 block, attacking Clementine operators
- Fast validation: derive keys on both sides for adversarial indices and compare
