# Q200: CommitDelegationToTier owner binding against distribution withdraw address

## Question
Can unprivileged delegator enter through `msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then delegate normally, submit MsgCommitDelegationToTier for a partial amount, then exit with delegation, causing `distribution withdraw address` to diverge so the invariant `committed stake cannot skip exit duration or min-lock rules` fails and the attacker can combine immediate exit with committed delegation to withdraw stake earlier than permitted, leading to High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.CommitDelegationToTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgCommitDelegationToTier transaction
- Attacker controls: DelegatorAddress, Id, Amount, ValidatorAddress, TriggerExitImmediately, pre-existing delegation state
- Exploit idea: combine immediate exit with committed delegation to withdraw stake earlier than permitted by testing the owner binding angle against `distribution withdraw address` during `delegate normally, submit MsgCommitDelegationToTier for a partial amount, then exit with delegation`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: committed stake cannot skip exit duration or min-lock rules; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High cross-module staking, distribution, and tieredrewards accounting corruption with fund-loss impact; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test covering ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, Delegate, and position persistence; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
