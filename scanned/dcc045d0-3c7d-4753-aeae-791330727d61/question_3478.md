# Q3478: Chain-id canonicalization resolves the wrong config via Address Caip-2 Formatting Variants / Wrong Lookup Would Not in GenesisState.Validate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with address and CAIP-2 formatting variants that target registry lookups when a wrong lookup would not be caught by offchain honesty alone, and cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it format a chain id so execution consumes another chain's enabled flags, gateway settings, or confirmations, breaking the invariant that each external chain id must bind to exactly one canonical config for execution, and resulting in Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/types/genesis.go::GenesisState.Validate
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: address and CAIP-2 formatting variants that target registry lookups
- Exploit idea: Cause `GenesisState.Validate` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can format a chain id so execution consumes another chain's enabled flags, gateway settings, or confirmations.
- Invariant to test: each external chain id must bind to exactly one canonical config for execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss or permanent freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
