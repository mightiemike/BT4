# Q1844: Observation canonicalization merges distinct destination results via Cross-Chain Flow Makes Push / Outbound Is Value-Bearing Refund-Bearing in MsgVoteOutbound.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with a cross-chain flow that makes Push Chain create one or more outbounds when the outbound is value-bearing or refund-bearing, and cause `MsgVoteOutbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it shape tx-hash or error-formatting variants so honest observations of different outcomes land on one ballot, breaking the invariant that one outbound ballot must represent exactly one destination-chain outcome, and resulting in Wrong refund/revert handling leading to direct loss or permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_outbound.go::MsgVoteOutbound.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: a cross-chain flow that makes Push Chain create one or more outbounds
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteOutbound.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can shape tx-hash or error-formatting variants so honest observations of different outcomes land on one ballot.
- Invariant to test: one outbound ballot must represent exactly one destination-chain outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong refund/revert handling leading to direct loss or permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
