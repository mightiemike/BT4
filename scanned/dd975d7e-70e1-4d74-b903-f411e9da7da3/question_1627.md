# Q1627: uint-to-list-u64 via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `uint-to-list-u64` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
