# Q2768: SendTransfer source sink direction against escrow address

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `Keeper.SendTransfer` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, focusing on packet token order, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then send at timeout boundary and then replay ack/timeout callbacks in valid order tests, causing `escrow address` to diverge so the invariant `native NFTs are escrowed exactly once and vouchers are burned exactly once` fails and the attacker can escrow or burn fewer NFTs than the packet claims and mint unbacked vouchers remotely, leading to Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/keeper/relay.go::Keeper.SendTransfer
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTransfer for nft-transfer
- Attacker controls: SourcePort, SourceChannel, ClassId, TokenIds, Sender, Receiver, timeout height, timeout timestamp
- Exploit idea: escrow or burn fewer NFTs than the packet claims and mint unbacked vouchers remotely by testing the source sink direction angle against `escrow address` during `send at timeout boundary and then replay ack/timeout callbacks in valid order tests`, with specific focus on packet token order.
- Invariant to test: native NFTs are escrowed exactly once and vouchers are burned exactly once; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unbacked NFT voucher minting, duplicate withdrawal, or unauthorized unescrow; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: IBC app test over SendTransfer, createOutgoingPacket, OnAcknowledgementPacket, and OnTimeoutPacket; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
