# Q0701: unwrap-status via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), drive `unwrap-status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111) — which resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic` — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111` -> `unwrap-status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `unwrap-status` resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
