# Q3220: Outbound identity collision cross-links two payouts via Destination-Chain Observation Fields Such / Outbound Is Value-Bearing Refund-Bearing in Keeper.getSwapQuoteForRefund

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg` when the outbound is value-bearing or refund-bearing, and cause `Keeper.getSwapQuoteForRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so that it make two distinct outbounds share one id so finalization or refunds update the wrong record, breaking the invariant that each outbound id must bind to exactly one destination action and one refund/revert lifecycle, and resulting in Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/outbound.go::Keeper.getSwapQuoteForRefund
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: destination-chain observation fields such as `tx_hash`, `block_height`, `success`, `gas_fee_used`, and `error_msg`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.getSwapQuoteForRefund` to charge, refund, or allocate the wrong amount or wrong asset semantics, so it can make two distinct outbounds share one id so finalization or refunds update the wrong record.
- Invariant to test: each outbound id must bind to exactly one destination action and one refund/revert lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
