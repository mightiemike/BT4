# Q3119: TSS vote validation accepts semantically impossible combinations via Gasless Tss Vote Messages / Attacker Does Not Already in MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with gasless TSS vote messages submitted from an unfunded attacker account when the attacker does not already control a UV, admin, or governance key, and cause `MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step, breaking the invariant that TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying, and resulting in Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_update_params.go::MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: gasless TSS vote messages submitted from an unfunded attacker account
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateParams.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
