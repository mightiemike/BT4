# Q1674: Signer-owner mismatch executes a victim UEA action via Payload Fields Such As / Account Can Be Auto-Deployed in MsgExecutePayload.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType` when the account can be auto-deployed because it is pre-funded, and cause `MsgExecutePayload.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address, breaking the invariant that only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_execute_payload.go::MsgExecutePayload.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: payload fields such as `to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, `deadline`, and `vType`
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgExecutePayload.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address.
- Invariant to test: only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
