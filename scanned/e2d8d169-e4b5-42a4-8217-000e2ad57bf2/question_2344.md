# Q2344: Join/leave transitions leave a ghost voter in critical paths via Direct Msgupdateuniversalvalidator Related Uvalidator / Mutated Identity Would Affect in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message when the mutated identity would affect live cross-chain flows, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it use state transitions so a removed or not-yet-added UV still counts or still owns external identity, breaking the invariant that UV lifecycle changes must update all voting and identity surfaces atomically, and resulting in Wrong finalization or permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: a direct `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator` or related `uvalidator` message
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can use state transitions so a removed or not-yet-added UV still counts or still owns external identity.
- Invariant to test: UV lifecycle changes must update all voting and identity surfaces atomically
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
