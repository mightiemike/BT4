# Q0537: find-asset via liquidate: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `min-collateral-expected`, drive `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) — which returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic` — to pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `liquidate` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-asset` touches, run `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
