# Q5083: find-debt-scaled via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `find-debt-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
