# Q0903: find-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
`find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-asset` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
