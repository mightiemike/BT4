# Q5580: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `is-liquidation-paused` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
