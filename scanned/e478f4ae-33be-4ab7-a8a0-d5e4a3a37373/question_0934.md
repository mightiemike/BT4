# Q0934: find via collateral-remove: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
