# Q1433: Ballot-key derivation omits a field that changes execution outcome via Fields Feed Directly Into / Different Observers May Supply in Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id with fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys when different observers may supply formatting variants of the same logical event, and cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it cause two observations with different fund or execution consequences to share one vote identity, breaking the invariant that ballot keys must include every field that can change the eventual value-moving outcome, and resulting in Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/universal_tx.go::Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled deposit, payload, outbound, or observation that feeds a derived key or id
- Attacker controls: fields that feed directly into UTX ids, ballot ids, revert ids, rescue ids, or reverse-lookup keys
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.BuildPcUniversalTxKey` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can cause two observations with different fund or execution consequences to share one vote identity.
- Invariant to test: ballot keys must include every field that can change the eventual value-moving outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization with direct loss or permanent freeze
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that constructs the two crafted inputs and compare the derived ids plus the downstream replay/finalization behavior
