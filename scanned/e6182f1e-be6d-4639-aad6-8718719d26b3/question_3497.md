# Q3497: Bootstrap median can be defined from an attacker-manipulated vote set via Repeated Votes Vote Updates / First Write Stale Update in MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends, breaking the invariant that initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_chain_meta.go::MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: repeated votes or vote updates that stress median and staleness logic
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can arrive at the first write with fewer independent fresh votes than the logic intends.
- Invariant to test: initial chain-meta values must not be attacker-definable from an insufficient or duplicate vote set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
