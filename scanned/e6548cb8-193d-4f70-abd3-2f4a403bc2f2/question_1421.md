# Q1421: EVM height checkpoint - ordering/finality double record

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a public `sendFunds` transaction on an in-scope EVM gateway with attacker-chosen token, amount, recipient, payload, and revert fields and use control over log ordering across adjacent blocks plus the exact reorg and confirmation timing so that `updateLastProcessedBlock` create duplicate or conflicting local records that later produce double voting, double execution, or a permanent stuck retry loop, breaking the invariant that every observed EVM log maps to exactly one canonical `EventData` payload and one confirmation policy and leading to unauthorized mint, release, or refund of value on Push Chain or the destination chain?

## Target
- File/function: universalClient/chains/evm/event_listener.go:updateLastProcessedBlock
- Entrypoint: submit a public `sendFunds` transaction on an in-scope EVM gateway with attacker-chosen token, amount, recipient, payload, and revert fields
- Attacker controls: log ordering across adjacent blocks plus the exact reorg and confirmation timing
- Exploit idea: create duplicate or conflicting local records that later produce double voting, double execution, or a permanent stuck retry loop
- Invariant to test: every observed EVM log maps to exactly one canonical `EventData` payload and one confirmation policy
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized mint, release, or refund of value on Push Chain or the destination chain
- Fast validation: force a shallow reorg or replay around the confirmer window and check whether conflicting `EventData` rows or duplicate vote attempts appear
