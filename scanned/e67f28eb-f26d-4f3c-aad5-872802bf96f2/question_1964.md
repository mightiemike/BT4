# Q1964: Hooks.BeforeValidatorSlashed Hooks.AfterRedelegationCompleted validator lifecycle hooks owner binding against event ref counts

## Question
Can delegator or validator participant using normal staking transactions enter through `Hooks.BeforeValidatorSlashed / Hooks.AfterRedelegationCompleted / validator lifecycle hooks` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling validator lifecycle events, slash fraction, redelegation completion, position distribution across validators, focusing on staking share deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then create positions, redelegate, then trigger completion hook and claim, causing `event ref counts` to diverge so the invariant `slash handling cannot leave position shares overstated versus staking keeper state` fails and the attacker can double update validator counts and voting power through lifecycle hook ordering, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/hooks.go::Hooks.BeforeValidatorSlashed / Hooks.AfterRedelegationCompleted / validator lifecycle hooks
- Entrypoint: staking module hook triggered by normal validator/delegator actions
- Attacker controls: validator lifecycle events, slash fraction, redelegation completion, position distribution across validators
- Exploit idea: double update validator counts and voting power through lifecycle hook ordering by testing the owner binding angle against `event ref counts` during `create positions, redelegate, then trigger completion hook and claim`, with specific focus on staking share deltas.
- Invariant to test: slash handling cannot leave position shares overstated versus staking keeper state; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: app integration test driving staking hooks with tiered rewards positions; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
