# Q4463: ubalance via redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `min-out`, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-out`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
