# Q3537: zip via repay: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, drive `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) — which pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `repay` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `zip` touches, run `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
