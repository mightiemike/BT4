# Q5142: accrue-user-collateral via borrow: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `borrow` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the future mask produced by the new debt bit across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
