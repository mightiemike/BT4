# Q2665: system-borrow via repay: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) — which independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `repay` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `system-borrow` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
