# Q4229: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via accrue: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `accrue` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
