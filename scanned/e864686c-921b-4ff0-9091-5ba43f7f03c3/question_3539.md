# Q3539: get-full-position via collateral-remove: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
