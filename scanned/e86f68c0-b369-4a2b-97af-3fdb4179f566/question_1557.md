# Q1557: transferDelegationToPosition owner binding against redelegation status

## Question
Can delegator using MsgCommitDelegationToTier enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then commit just after validator token/share exchange rate changes, causing `redelegation status` to diverge so the invariant `validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators` fails and the attacker can escape pending redelegation slash by moving receiving stake into tiered rewards, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationToPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgCommitDelegationToTier internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: owner, posDelAddr, validatorAddr, amount, incoming redelegation state
- Exploit idea: escape pending redelegation slash by moving receiving stake into tiered rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `redelegation status` during `commit just after validator token/share exchange rate changes`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: validator status checks prevent transfer to non-bonded validators; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: staking keeper test around HasReceivingRedelegation, ValidateUnbondAmount, Unbond, and Delegate; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
