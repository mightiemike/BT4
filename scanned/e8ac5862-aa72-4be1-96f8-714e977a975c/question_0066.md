# Q0066: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `add-user-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
