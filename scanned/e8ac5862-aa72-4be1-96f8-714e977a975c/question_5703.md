# Q5703: mask-to-list-iter via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-to-list-iter` touches, run `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
