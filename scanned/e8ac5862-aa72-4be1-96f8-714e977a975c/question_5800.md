# Q5800: get-cached-indexes via supply-collateral-add: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
