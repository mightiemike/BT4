# Q2967: Adversarial observation volume turns ballot iteration into a chain-wide DoS via Vote-Bearing Messages If Signer / Honest Uvs Later Vote in StakingHooks.BeforeDelegationCreated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account when honest UVs later vote the observations without malicious-validator assumptions, and cause `StakingHooks.BeforeDelegationCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so that it create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution, breaking the invariant that publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/staking_hooks.go::StakingHooks.BeforeDelegationCreated
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: vote-bearing messages if signer restrictions can be bypassed by an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `StakingHooks.BeforeDelegationCreated` to bind a new record or derived action to the wrong live context, so it can create many user-triggered observations that force expensive ballot maintenance inside block execution.
- Invariant to test: publicly triggerable ballots must not let one attacker overload validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
