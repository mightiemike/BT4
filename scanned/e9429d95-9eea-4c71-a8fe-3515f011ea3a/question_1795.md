# Q1795: alt_resolution_enabled is not deterministic across nodes (deshred_transaction_notifier_interface.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `alt_resolution_enabled` in `ledger/src/deshred_transaction_notifier_interface.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make the blockstore's view of a slot's contents disagree with the bank state derived from that slot, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `alt_resolution_enabled` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/deshred_transaction_notifier_interface.rs` -> `alt_resolution_enabled()` (around line 25)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Find input to `alt_resolution_enabled` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `alt_resolution_enabled` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `alt_resolution_enabled` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can create account data that makes accounts-hash, lattice-hash, or capitalization accounting diverge between honest nodes, producing a bank-hash mismatch and a fork or stalled cluster.
