# Q1712: transferDelegationFromPosition owner binding against unbonded shares

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then repeat partial exits until just above min lock and then claim rewards, causing `unbonded shares` to diverge so the invariant `full exit consumes all position shares and leaves no reward-bearing dust` fails and the attacker can recover more delegated stake than the position owns through share rounding, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/transfer_delegation.go::Keeper.transferDelegationFromPosition
- Entrypoint: MsgExitTierWithDelegation internal delegation transfer
- Attacker controls: PositionState, valAddr, amount, validator exchange rate, redelegation state
- Exploit idea: recover more delegated stake than the position owns through share rounding by testing the owner binding angle against `unbonded shares` during `repeat partial exits until just above min lock and then claim rewards`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: full exit consumes all position shares and leaves no reward-bearing dust; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper fuzz test over amount/share boundaries around ExitTierWithDelegation; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
