# Q3226: Signer-owner mismatch executes a victim UEA action via Repeated Payload Submission Reuses / Target Uea Already Holds in Keeper.DeployUEAV2

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `Keeper.DeployUEAV2` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address, breaking the invariant that only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/deploy_uea.go::Keeper.DeployUEAV2
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a repeated payload submission that reuses the same signed authorization material
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.DeployUEAV2` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can bind an attacker-submitted gasless payload to the wrong owner or UEA address.
- Invariant to test: only the true authorized UEA owner should be able to trigger value-moving execution for that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or unauthorized value transfer
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
