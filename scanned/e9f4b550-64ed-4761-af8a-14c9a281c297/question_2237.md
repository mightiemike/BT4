# Q2237: MintNFT owner binding against collection

## Question
Can denom owner or authz grantee enter through `msgServer.MintNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, focusing on denom owner authority, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then mint under an IBC-prefixed denom and send through nft-transfer, causing `collection` to diverge so the invariant `recipient ownership and collection counts update atomically` fails and the attacker can mint an NFT in someone else's denom and transfer or bridge it as valuable collateral, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.MintNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgMintNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Recipient, DenomId, Id, Name, URI, Data
- Exploit idea: mint an NFT in someone else's denom and transfer or bridge it as valuable collateral by testing the owner binding angle against `collection` during `mint under an IBC-prefixed denom and send through nft-transfer`, with specific focus on denom owner authority.
- Invariant to test: recipient ownership and collection counts update atomically; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an economically valuable NFT through incorrect ownership state; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over MintNFT, collection indexes, owner indexes, and authz signer path; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
