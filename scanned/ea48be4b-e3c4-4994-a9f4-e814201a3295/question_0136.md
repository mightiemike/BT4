# Q0136: removal by txid over-matching via `calc_tx_id` (deposit_data_mempool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who calls the unauthenticated `citrea_sendRawDepositTransaction` with a hand-built deposit blob, controlling submission timing relative to block sealing, drive `calc_tx_id` in `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` so that the deposits `remove_deposits` erases and the deposits actually included in the block stop being the same set, breaking the invariant that only included deposits leave the mempool?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/sequencer/src/deposit_data_mempool.rs` -> `calc_tx_id`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged party calls the unauthenticated `citrea_sendRawDepositTransaction` with a hand-built deposit blob
- Attacker controls: submission timing relative to block sealing
- Exploit idea: removal by txid over-matching - reach `calc_tx_id` from that entrypoint and force the divergence where the deposits `remove_deposits` erases and the deposits actually included in the block stop being the same set; the adjacent symbols in the same file that carry the value are `DepositDataMempool`, `make_deposit_tx_from_data`, `fetch_deposits`, `remove_deposits`, so evaluate both sides of the equality through them before and after the attacker's action.
- Invariant to test: only included deposits leave the mempool
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds (recovery requires a hard fork)
- Fast validation: include one deposit whose txid collides with a pending one and assert the pending one survives
