# Q1106: Gateway or vault method selection misroutes user value via User-Controlled Inbound Outbound Forces / Same Asset May Appear in isContractDeployed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution with a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset when the same asset may appear in multiple encodings or address formats, and cause `isContractDeployed` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so that it make registry-derived method metadata point a live flow at the wrong destination semantics, breaking the invariant that registry-selected methods must remain bound to the intended chain and asset only, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/genesis.go::isContractDeployed
- Entrypoint: a normal inbound, payload, refund, or outbound flow that consumes `uregistry` mappings during execution
- Attacker controls: a user-controlled inbound or outbound that forces reverse lookup from PRC20 back to source asset
- Exploit idea: Cause `isContractDeployed` to trigger an unsafe state-transition edge case, so it can make registry-derived method metadata point a live flow at the wrong destination semantics.
- Invariant to test: registry-selected methods must remain bound to the intended chain and asset only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper or integration test that drives a normal user flow through the crafted registry lookup and inspect the chosen chain/token semantics
