# Q1799: active via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
`active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
