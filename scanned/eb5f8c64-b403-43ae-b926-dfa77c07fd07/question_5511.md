# Q5511: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-remove: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `filter-out-debt-asset` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
