# Q0344: write-feed via call-ststx-ratio: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) in a state where it consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? Given that it applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `write-feed` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
