# Q3639: Verification data is replayable across chains or account identities via Gasless Msgexecutepayload Msgmigrateuea Chosen / Target Uea Already Holds in Keeper.VoteOnInboundBallot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize with a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData` when the target UEA already holds spendable value or can emit outbounds, and cause `Keeper.VoteOnInboundBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context, breaking the invariant that verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/voting.go::Keeper.VoteOnInboundBallot
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA`, or a user-controlled source-chain payload that honest UVs later finalize
- Attacker controls: a gasless `MsgExecutePayload` or `MsgMigrateUEA` with chosen `UniversalAccountId`, payload, and `verificationData`
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteOnInboundBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can reuse signed authorization material in a different chain or owner context.
- Invariant to test: verification material must be single-use within one intended chain/account domain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds or duplicate unauthorized execution
- Fast validation: write a keeper test around the payload entrypoint and assert whether a victim UEA or outbound can be reached from attacker-controlled authorization material
