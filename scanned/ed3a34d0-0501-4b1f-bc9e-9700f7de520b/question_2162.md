# Q2162: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
