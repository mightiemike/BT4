# Q1541: TSS vote validation accepts semantically impossible combinations via Direct Utss Message Submission / Accepted Tss State Would in MsgInitiateTssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers with a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers when accepted TSS state would affect live outbound signing or migration, and cause `MsgInitiateTssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step, breaking the invariant that TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying, and resulting in Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/types/msg_tss_key_process.go::MsgInitiateTssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Attacker controls: a direct `utss` message submission against vote, process, or migration handlers
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgInitiateTssKeyProcess.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can submit a message that basic validation accepts even though it should never represent a safe TSS step.
- Invariant to test: TSS vote validation must reject impossible state transitions before tallying
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong TSS finalization leading to fund loss or freeze
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and check whether the TSS vote or process state changes anyway
