# Q1002: ClearPosition owner binding against LastKnownBonded

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClearPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then clear exit around tier close-only update and attempt to keep a position alive, causing `LastKnownBonded` to diverge so the invariant `clearing after unlock cannot hide active unbonding or undelegated state` fails and the attacker can clear another user's exit to block their withdrawal or redirect rewards through later state, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClearPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClearPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, delegation state
- Exploit idea: clear another user's exit to block their withdrawal or redirect rewards through later state by testing the owner binding angle against `LastKnownBonded` during `clear exit around tier close-only update and attempt to keep a position alive`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: clearing after unlock cannot hide active unbonding or undelegated state; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state test for ClearPosition at pre-unlock, exact-unlock, and post-unlock times; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
