# Q4448: calc-utilization via liquidate-redeem: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `calc-utilization` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
