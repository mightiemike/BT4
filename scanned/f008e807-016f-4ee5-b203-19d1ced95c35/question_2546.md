# Q2546: BurnNFT owner binding against NFT existence

## Question
Can NFT owner enter through `msgServer.BurnNFT` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state, focusing on token owner authority, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then burn after IBC send failure or timeout state is pending, causing `NFT existence` to diverge so the invariant `authz and feegrant cannot burn a token outside the granted owner authority` fails and the attacker can burn a voucher but still receive a refund that mints a duplicate backed asset, leading to High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path moving or destroying NFTs contrary to signer intent?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.BurnNFT
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgBurnNFT transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, DenomId, Id, escrow ownership state
- Exploit idea: burn a voucher but still receive a refund that mints a duplicate backed asset by testing the owner binding angle against `NFT existence` during `burn after IBC send failure or timeout state is pending`, with specific focus on token owner authority.
- Invariant to test: authz and feegrant cannot burn a token outside the granted owner authority; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High signed transaction/authz/feegrant path moving or destroying NFTs contrary to signer intent; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over BurnNFT plus nft-transfer refund and timeout state; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
