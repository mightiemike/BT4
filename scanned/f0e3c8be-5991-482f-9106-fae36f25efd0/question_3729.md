# Q3729: Enum or status validation allows an impossible live state via Whitespace, Padding, Casing, Zero-Value / Later Execution Assumes Basic in GenesisState.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later when later execution assumes basic validation already ruled the dangerous case out, and cause `GenesisState.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it submit a message or event that basic checks accept even though downstream logic assumes the state cannot exist, breaking the invariant that only states that the rest of the module can safely process should pass validation, and resulting in Direct loss, permanent freeze, or chain halt?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/genesis.go::GenesisState.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: whitespace, padding, casing, or zero-value edge cases that normalize later
- Exploit idea: Cause `GenesisState.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can submit a message or event that basic checks accept even though downstream logic assumes the state cannot exist.
- Invariant to test: only states that the rest of the module can safely process should pass validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct loss, permanent freeze, or chain halt
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
