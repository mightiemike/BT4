# Q2348: linear-interpolate via borrow: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `borrow` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
