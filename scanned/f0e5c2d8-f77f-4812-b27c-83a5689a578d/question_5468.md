# Q5468: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-remove: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
