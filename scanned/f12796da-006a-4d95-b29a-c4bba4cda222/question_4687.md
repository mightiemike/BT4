# Q4687: check-confidence via collateral-remove: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
`check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, violating the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `check-confidence` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
