# Q5568: next-index via deposit: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `deposit` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `recipient`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
