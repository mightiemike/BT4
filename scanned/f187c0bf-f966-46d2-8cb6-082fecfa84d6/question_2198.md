# Q2198: IssueDenom owner binding against Denom

## Question
Can unprivileged account enter through `msgServer.IssueDenom` by use signer, sender, recipient, and authz grantee fields that diverge but remain syntactically valid while controlling Sender, Id, Name, Schema, focusing on authz signer semantics, under the precondition that a valuable denom or NFT exists under the NFT module, then issue denom, transfer NFTs, and attempt IBC send through nft-transfer, causing `Denom` to diverge so the invariant `address prefix validation binds the denom owner to the signer` fails and the attacker can bypass owner checks through malformed denom ids or address encoding, leading to Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.IssueDenom
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgIssueDenom transaction
- Attacker controls: Sender, Id, Name, Schema, Uri, address prefix
- Exploit idea: bypass owner checks through malformed denom ids or address encoding by testing the owner binding angle against `Denom` during `issue denom, transfer NFTs, and attempt IBC send through nft-transfer`, with specific focus on authz signer semantics.
- Invariant to test: address prefix validation binds the denom owner to the signer; additionally, signer, denom owner, token owner, and recipient authority cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical unauthorized NFT mint, burn, transfer, denom takeover, or seizure of a valuable NFT; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper test over IssueDenom, MintNFT, IBC class hash, and collection lookup; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
