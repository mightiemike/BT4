# Q3254: accrue-collateral-asset via liquidate: reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mut

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries? `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `liquidate` and reuse one price and index snapshot across a batch that mutates state between entries.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `accrue-collateral-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
