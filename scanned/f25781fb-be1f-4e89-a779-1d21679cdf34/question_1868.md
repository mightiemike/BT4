# Q1868: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate-redeem: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) in a state where it bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after? Given that it routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `vault-socialize-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
