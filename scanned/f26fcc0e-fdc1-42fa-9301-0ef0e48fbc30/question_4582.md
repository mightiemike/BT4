# Q4582: iter-find-superset via liquidate: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match, so the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `liquidate` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
