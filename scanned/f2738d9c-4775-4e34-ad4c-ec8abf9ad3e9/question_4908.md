# Q4908: get-asset-value via liquidate-multi: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, the invariant that every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: every second of elapsed time is charged exactly once, to one index, in one direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `get-asset-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
