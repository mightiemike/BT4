# Q4653: resolve-ztoken via supply-collateral-add: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) — which reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION — to strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-ztoken` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
