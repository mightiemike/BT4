# Q2541: get-liquidation-position via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), drive `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) — which returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against — to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-liquidation-position` touches, run `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
