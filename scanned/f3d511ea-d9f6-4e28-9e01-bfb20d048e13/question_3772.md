# Q3772: Eligible-voter snapshot drifts away from the observation lifecycle via Observation Variants Differ Only / Observation Outcome Changes Value-Moving in LifecycleEvent.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine with observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields when the observation outcome changes a value-moving or liveness-critical path, and cause `LifecycleEvent.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation, breaking the invariant that ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set, and resulting in Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/lifecyle_event.go::LifecycleEvent.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: an attacker-created observation that honest UVs later vote through the generic ballot engine
- Attacker controls: observation variants that differ only in formatting, canonicalization, or status fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `LifecycleEvent.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a ballot count a validator set different from the one the protocol intended for that observation.
- Invariant to test: ballot eligibility must be stable enough that one observation cannot be finalized by the wrong set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization and direct loss/freeze of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that feeds the crafted observation variants into the ballot engine and inspect ids, vote counts, and terminal hooks
