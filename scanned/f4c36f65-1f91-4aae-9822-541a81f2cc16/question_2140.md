# Q2140: write-feed via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls call ordering within the block reach `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
