# Q996: ClearPosition owner binding against LastBonusAccrual

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.ClearPosition` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, focusing on position primary store, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then call ClearPosition on a non-triggered position and verify no hidden state changes, causing `LastBonusAccrual` to diverge so the invariant `clearing after unlock cannot hide active unbonding or undelegated state` fails and the attacker can clear an exit while unbonding exists and later withdraw or delegate the same funds twice, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.ClearPosition
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgClearPosition transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, unbonding state, delegation state
- Exploit idea: clear an exit while unbonding exists and later withdraw or delegate the same funds twice by testing the owner binding angle against `LastBonusAccrual` during `call ClearPosition on a non-triggered position and verify no hidden state changes`, with specific focus on position primary store.
- Invariant to test: clearing after unlock cannot hide active unbonding or undelegated state; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: keeper state test for ClearPosition at pre-unlock, exact-unlock, and post-unlock times; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
