# Q3270: refresh via collateral-add: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `collateral-add` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
