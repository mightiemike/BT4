# Q0572: Lifecycle state confusion makes a non-UV effectively eligible via State Transitions Around Join/Leave/Tombstone / Downstream Modules Trust Uv in MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity with state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe when downstream modules trust the UV identity for voting or offchain routing, and cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes, breaking the invariant that only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization, and resulting in Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/types/msg_update_universal_validator.go::MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct `uvalidator` message submission or a user-triggered flow that consumes UV identity
- Attacker controls: state transitions around join/leave/tombstone boundaries that attacker-triggered flows can observe
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgUpdateUniversalValidator.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can reach a state where an unapproved account is treated as active or bonded for voting purposes.
- Invariant to test: only legitimately active, bonded UVs should influence cross-chain finalization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong finalization causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that submits the crafted validator-identity mutation from an unprivileged context and inspect who can vote or which identity is stored
