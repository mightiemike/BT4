# Q1075: iter-lookup-debt via borrow: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
`iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved, violating the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `borrow` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `iter-lookup-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
