# Q4206: price-resolve via collateral-add: consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has alr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `price-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373) consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved? `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater, so the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373` -> `price-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Reach it through `collateral-add` and consume a cache entry after the vault it describes has already moved.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `price-resolve` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
