# Q1030: accrue via deposit: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, so the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `deposit` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
