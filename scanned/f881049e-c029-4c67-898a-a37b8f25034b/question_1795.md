# Q1795: processEventsAndClaimBonus owner binding against LastKnownBonded

## Question
Can position owner enter through `Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, focusing on bank balance deltas, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then claim after position creation at the same block time as a validator event, causing `LastKnownBonded` to diverge so the invariant `bonus pool pays no more than computed rewards and available balance` fails and the attacker can double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq, leading to High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/claim_rewards.go::Keeper.processEventsAndClaimBonus
- Entrypoint: ClaimTierRewards and position lifecycle reward claims
- Attacker controls: claim timing, validator event history, position state, tier bonus APY, delegation shares
- Exploit idea: double claim the same validator event segment by failing to advance LastEventSeq by testing the owner binding angle against `LastKnownBonded` during `claim after position creation at the same block time as a validator event`, with specific focus on bank balance deltas.
- Invariant to test: bonus pool pays no more than computed rewards and available balance; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High repeated or inflated base or bonus reward claim with direct economic loss; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: state-machine keeper test with synthetic validator events and reward pool balance checks; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
