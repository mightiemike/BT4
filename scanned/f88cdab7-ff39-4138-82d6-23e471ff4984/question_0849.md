# Q849: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against ExitUnlockAt

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on owner/tier/validator indexes, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then trigger exit on a slashed or zero-share position and attempt withdrawal, causing `ExitUnlockAt` to diverge so the invariant `withdraw and undelegate eligibility must depend on the persisted exit time, not event order` fails and the attacker can combine exit timing with validator events to overclaim bonus rewards, leading to Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: combine exit timing with validator events to overclaim bonus rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `ExitUnlockAt` during `trigger exit on a slashed or zero-share position and attempt withdrawal`, with specific focus on owner/tier/validator indexes.
- Invariant to test: withdraw and undelegate eligibility must depend on the persisted exit time, not event order; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tiered rewards position takeover, delegated-stake theft, or reward-pool draining; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
