# Q1377: Cross-module query path allocates attacker-sized derived objects via Public Grpc, Abci, Query / Queried Collection Can Grow in Querier.AllFinalizedBallots

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node with public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests when the queried collection can grow under normal protocol use, and cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it force the server to build large derived responses from user-controlled filters or ids, breaking the invariant that derived query responses must remain resource-bounded for public callers, and resulting in Widespread node overload or inability to finalize?

## Target
- File/function: x/uvalidator/keeper/query_server.go::Querier.AllFinalizedBallots
- Entrypoint: a public gRPC/ABCI query to the node
- Attacker controls: public gRPC, ABCI, or query inputs such as ids, pagination params, and repeated requests
- Exploit idea: Cause `Querier.AllFinalizedBallots` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can force the server to build large derived responses from user-controlled filters or ids.
- Invariant to test: derived query responses must remain resource-bounded for public callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Widespread node overload or inability to finalize
- Fast validation: write a query-server test or benchmark that sends the crafted public request pattern and measure iteration, allocation, and error behavior
