# Q1749: interpolate-rate via accrue: bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it aft

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after, breaking the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and bind a balance before an accrual and assert against it after.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
