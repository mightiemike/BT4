# Q0227: create_and_canonicalize_directories confuses account types or owners (utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `create_and_canonicalize_directories` in `accounts-db/src/utils.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and have `create_and_canonicalize_directories` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`create_and_canonicalize_directories` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/utils.rs` -> `create_and_canonicalize_directories()` (around line 139)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `create_and_canonicalize_directories` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `create_and_canonicalize_directories` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `create_and_canonicalize_directories` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
