# Q2356: filter-out-debt-asset via borrow: pass a health check and then change, in the same transacti

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `borrow` and pass a health check and then change, in the same transaction, the quantity it checked.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
