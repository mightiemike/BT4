# Q1524: accrue via call-ststx-ratio: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) in a state where it leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time? Given that it advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
