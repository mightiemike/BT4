# Q3530: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, so the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
