# Q1153: total-assets-preview via redeem: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, drive `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) — which re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued — to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, breaking the invariant that the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `redeem` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: the state a safety check approved is the state the money movement executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, then read `total-assets-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
