# Q3432: ParseClassTrace IsAwayFromOrigin RemoveClassPrefix IBCClassID source sink direction against escrow address selection

## Question
Can NFT sender or IBC packet sender enter through `ParseClassTrace / IsAwayFromOrigin / RemoveClassPrefix / IBCClassID` by send class ids through source, sink, and return-path channel combinations while controlling class id path, port ids, channel ids, ibc hash, focusing on escrow custody, under the precondition that a valid ICS721 channel and native or voucher NFT exist, then use boundary class ids with slashes in the base class id, causing `escrow address selection` to diverge so the invariant `source/sink direction matches the ICS721 path rules` fails and the attacker can make native and voucher class ids alias in lookup logic and bypass backing assumptions, leading to Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: x/nft-transfer/types/trace.go::ParseClassTrace / IsAwayFromOrigin / RemoveClassPrefix / IBCClassID
- Entrypoint: MsgTransfer and IBC receive/refund class-id handling
- Attacker controls: class id path, port ids, channel ids, ibc hash, base class id
- Exploit idea: make native and voucher class ids alias in lookup logic and bypass backing assumptions by testing the source sink direction angle against `escrow address selection` during `use boundary class ids with slashes in the base class id`, with specific focus on escrow custody.
- Invariant to test: source/sink direction matches the ICS721 path rules; additionally, source/sink direction must determine escrow, burn, mint, and unescrow consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical loss or permanent lock of an escrowed NFT during IBC transfer lifecycle; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: unit and keeper tests over trace parsing plus full SendTransfer/OnRecvPacket round trips; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
