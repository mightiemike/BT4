# Q0532: calc-utilization via liquidate-redeem: strand value on the market contract when a later step of a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and strand value on the market contract when a later step of a composite call fails.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
