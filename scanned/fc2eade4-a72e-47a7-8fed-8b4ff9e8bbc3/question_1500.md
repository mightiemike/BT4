# Q1500: unpack-u16 via deposit: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `deposit` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: a failed sub-step aborts the transaction or is explicitly compensated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
