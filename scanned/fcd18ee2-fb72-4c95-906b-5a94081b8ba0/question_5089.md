# Q5089: calc-cumulative-debt via redeem: absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, drive `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) — which multiplies scaled principal by an index — to absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state, breaking the invariant that when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `redeem` and absorb a sub-step failure into a fold flag and proceed on partial state.
- Invariant to test: when a multi-step entry point aborts, no value is stranded and no identifier survives
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, then read `calc-cumulative-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
