# Q2338: Concurrent-process assumptions break under attacker-timed flows via Two Logically Distinct Migrations / Attacker Can Create More in Keeper.VoteOnTssBallot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state with two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields when the attacker can create more than one related flow over time, and cause `Keeper.VoteOnTssBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it reach overlapping TSS state transitions that the module assumes cannot coexist, breaking the invariant that TSS lifecycle must serialize mutually exclusive processes safely, and resulting in Wrong signing state or inability to finalize cross-chain funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/utss/keeper/voting.go::Keeper.VoteOnTssBallot
- Entrypoint: a user-created outbound or migration-dependent flow that later touches TSS state
- Attacker controls: two logically distinct migrations or events that differ only in formatting-sensitive fields
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.VoteOnTssBallot` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can reach overlapping TSS state transitions that the module assumes cannot coexist.
- Invariant to test: TSS lifecycle must serialize mutually exclusive processes safely
- Expected Immunefi impact: Wrong signing state or inability to finalize cross-chain funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that drives the crafted process/migration flow to finality and inspect whether the active key and pending indexes stay consistent
