# Q0499: Unprivileged token-config creation bypasses authority via Chain Token Config Payloads / Attacker Does Not Already in Keeper.UpdateChainConfig

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path with chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account when the attacker does not already control admin or governance keys, and cause `Keeper.UpdateChainConfig` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so that it whitelist an attacker-chosen token mapping without authorized registry control, breaking the invariant that token whitelist mutations must remain strictly authority-gated, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds by wrong-asset mapping?

## Target
- File/function: x/uregistry/keeper/msg_update_chain_config.go::Keeper.UpdateChainConfig
- Entrypoint: a direct `uregistry` message submission against an authority-gated path
- Attacker controls: chain and token config payloads that would be dangerous if accepted from an unprivileged account
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.UpdateChainConfig` to overwrite a different live record than the caller should be able to affect, so it can whitelist an attacker-chosen token mapping without authorized registry control.
- Invariant to test: token whitelist mutations must remain strictly authority-gated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds by wrong-asset mapping
- Fast validation: write a message-server test from an unprivileged signer and assert whether the registry mutation commits or can be wrapped to commit
