# Q803: TriggerExitFromTier owner binding against exit triggered flag

## Question
Can position owner enter through `msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier` by set signer, owner, grantee, or position owner fields to edge-case but valid account combinations while controlling Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration, focusing on distribution withdraw address routing, under the precondition that a valuable tiered rewards position or delegation exists under normal production rules, then combine trigger exit with redelegation and claim calls before unlock, causing `exit triggered flag` to diverge so the invariant `withdraw and undelegate eligibility must depend on the persisted exit time, not event order` fails and the attacker can combine exit timing with validator events to overclaim bonus rewards, leading to Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position?

## Target
- File/function: x/tieredrewards/keeper/msg_server.go::msgServer.TriggerExitFromTier
- Entrypoint: Cosmos SDK MsgTriggerExitFromTier transaction
- Attacker controls: Owner, PositionId, block time, tier ExitDuration
- Exploit idea: combine exit timing with validator events to overclaim bonus rewards by testing the owner binding angle against `exit triggered flag` during `combine trigger exit with redelegation and claim calls before unlock`, with specific focus on distribution withdraw address routing.
- Invariant to test: withdraw and undelegate eligibility must depend on the persisted exit time, not event order; additionally, owner, signer, distribution withdraw address, and position owner cannot diverge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical direct loss or unauthorized withdrawal of bonded CRO from a tiered rewards position; mapped to HackenProof Cronos in-scope direct fund/NFT loss, draining, unauthorized withdrawal, or unbacked asset creation.
- Fast validation: time-travel keeper test around TriggerExitFromTier, ClearPosition, TierUndelegate, and WithdrawFromTier; assert pre/post balances, owner indexes, shares, escrow, checkpoints, and module accounts match the invariant.
