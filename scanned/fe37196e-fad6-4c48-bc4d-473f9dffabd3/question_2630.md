# Q2630: Status transitions allow double refund or double remint via Outbound Whose Revert Instructions, / Outbound Is Value-Bearing Refund-Bearing in Keeper.RecordOutboundVote

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound` with an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action when the outbound is value-bearing or refund-bearing, and cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so that it move an outbound through observed, reverted, aborted, or refund-applied states more than once, breaking the invariant that each outbound should permit at most one terminal refund or remint outcome, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/keeper/pending_outbound.go::Keeper.RecordOutboundVote
- Entrypoint: a user-controlled cross-chain flow whose outbound is later observed via `MsgVoteOutbound`
- Attacker controls: an outbound whose revert instructions, gas token, or refund path are attacker-influenced through the originating action
- Exploit idea: Cause `Keeper.RecordOutboundVote` to push the wrong logical object through a vote or terminal state transition, so it can move an outbound through observed, reverted, aborted, or refund-applied states more than once.
- Invariant to test: each outbound should permit at most one terminal refund or remint outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a keeper integration test that finalizes the crafted outbound observation and inspect status transitions, refund math, and remint behavior
