# Q2944: Signer derivation and declared principal diverge after validation via Direct Message Event Payload / Attacker Can Choose Boundary-Case in PCTx.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with a direct message or event payload that reaches `ValidateBasic` or equivalent type-level checks when the attacker can choose boundary-case encodings directly, and cause `PCTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it present a message whose validated fields do not bind tightly enough to the actual signer, breaking the invariant that validated messages must not let one signer act for a different principal implicitly, and resulting in Unauthorized execution causing direct loss or permanent freezing?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/pc_tx.go::PCTx.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: a direct message or event payload that reaches `ValidateBasic` or equivalent type-level checks
- Exploit idea: Cause `PCTx.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can present a message whose validated fields do not bind tightly enough to the actual signer.
- Invariant to test: validated messages must not let one signer act for a different principal implicitly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized execution causing direct loss or permanent freezing
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
