# Q0178: sanitize_executable confuses account types or owners (meta.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `sanitize_executable` in `accounts-db/src/append_vec/meta.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and have `sanitize_executable` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`sanitize_executable` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/append_vec/meta.rs` -> `sanitize_executable()` (around line 151)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `sanitize_executable` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `sanitize_executable` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `sanitize_executable` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft account writes that make AccountsDB return stale, wrong-slot, or wrong-owner account state to execution, letting a later transaction spend or overwrite value it does not own.
