# Q3931: Address or owner validation uses the wrong namespace assumptions via Direct Message Event Payload / Attacker Can Choose Boundary-Case in UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution with a direct message or event payload that reaches `ValidateBasic` or equivalent type-level checks when the attacker can choose boundary-case encodings directly, and cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so that it make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another, breaking the invariant that address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site, and resulting in Direct theft/loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/universal_account_id.go::UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic
- Entrypoint: a direct message or event payload that reaches type-level validation before execution
- Attacker controls: a direct message or event payload that reaches `ValidateBasic` or equivalent type-level checks
- Exploit idea: Cause `UniversalAccountId.ValidateBasic` to accept a value whose later canonical or decoded form changes its security identity, so it can make a value pass validation as one address type and get used later as another.
- Invariant to test: address validation must match the exact namespace and downstream use site
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft/loss of funds
- Fast validation: write a focused Go test that proves the crafted object passes type validation and then reaches a more dangerous later interpretation
