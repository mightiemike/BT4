# Q1132: Median write and stored state diverge after an EVM-call edge case via Chain Identifiers Block-Height Values / First Write Stale Update in MsgVoteChainMeta.GetSigners

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values with chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges when the first write or a stale update materially changes settlement, and cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so that it leave the on-chain oracle and stored chain-meta record disagreeing about the last applied height or price, breaking the invariant that chain-meta storage and the EVM oracle must advance atomically to one consistent value, and resulting in Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft?

## Target
- File/function: x/uexecutor/types/msg_vote_chain_meta.go::MsgVoteChainMeta.GetSigners
- Entrypoint: a gasless `MsgVoteChainMeta` if signer checks can be bypassed, or any user flow whose settlement depends on chain-meta values
- Attacker controls: chain identifiers and block-height values that sit on canonicalization or ordering edges
- Exploit idea: Cause `MsgVoteChainMeta.GetSigners` to derive the wrong effective signer or omit the real principal, so it can leave the on-chain oracle and stored chain-meta record disagreeing about the last applied height or price.
- Invariant to test: chain-meta storage and the EVM oracle must advance atomically to one consistent value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds or wrong-fee theft
- Fast validation: write a keeper test that records the crafted votes or settlement context and inspect the stored median, EVM write, and downstream fee effects
