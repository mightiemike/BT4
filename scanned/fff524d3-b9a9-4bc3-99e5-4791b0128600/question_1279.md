# Q1279: ubalance via accrue: leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-c

## Question
`ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the utilization the rate is interpolated at, use that to leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time, violating the invariant that a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `accrue` and leave the accrual clock stale so a later interval double-counts elapsed time.
- Invariant to test: a value read from `index-cache` describes the vault as it is at the moment of use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, then read `ubalance` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
